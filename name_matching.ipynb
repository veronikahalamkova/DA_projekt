      "[['By Tom Westbrook and Swati Pandey SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian shares steadied from early losses on Monday as investors placed their hopes on a coordinated global monetary policy response to weather the damaging economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic. Pandemic fears pushed markets off a precipice last week, wiping more than $5 trillion from global share value as stocks cratered to their steepest slump in more than a decade. The sheer scale of losses prompted financial markets to price in policy responses from the U.S. Federal Reserve to the Bank of Japan and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Futures now imply a full 50 basis point cut by the Fed in March  while Australian markets are pricing in a quarter-point cut at the RBA\\'s Tuesday meeting. Also helping calm market nerves, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Monday the central bank would take necessary steps to stabilise financial markets. [ In equities, Chinese shares opened higher with the blue-chip index ( ) up 1.5%. MSCI\\'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) advanced 0.4%, turning around from a loss of about 0.3% earlier in the day. E-minis for the S&P500 ( ), which were down more than 1% at one point, were last up 0.3% while Japan\\'s Nikkei ( ), which opened 1.3% lower at a six month trough, climbed 0.4%. Australia\\'s S&P ASX/200 ( ), which had tumbled 3%, was last off 1.8%. Benchmark U.S. 10-Year Treasuries hit a fresh record low of 1.0750% ( ). Despite some stability in the market, analysts still expect volatility to persist. \"Any signs that new cases are beginning to taper could be seen as a positive catalyst for the market especially given that some of the market complacency has reduced with equity valuations much lower vs few weeks ago,\" Nomura analysts wrote in a note. \"In the very near term until 1Q reporting results, we expect Asian equities may remain quite volatile,\" they added. \"However, on a medium term basis we believe the risk-reward is now getting favourable, assuming the virus does not take the form of a virulent global pandemic.\" Leaders in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas rolled out bans on big gatherings and stricter travel restrictions over the weekend as cases of the new coronavirus spread. The epidemic, which began in China, has killed almost 3,000 people worldwide as authorities race to contain infections in Iran, Italy, South Korea and the United States. Both official and private surveys, released on Saturday and Monday respectively, showed China\\'s factory activity collapsing to its worst levels on record as the virus crippled broad areas of the economy. \"It is now highly probable that the coronavirus will spread globally,\" Citi analysts said in a note. \"Financial markets may over-react until they have visibility on the actual impact.\" Investor panic last week sent bonds soaring and stocks plunging. The S&P 500 index ( ) fell 11.5%, only its fifth double-digit weekly percentage drop since 1940. ( ) On Monday, oil extended losses before steadying on expectations OPEC may cut production. [O/R] Brent crude last traded at $50.41 per barrel ( ) and U.S. crude ( ) at $45.30 per barrel. In currencies, investors sought shelter in the Japanese yen, which jumped to a 20-week high on the dollar in tandem with the massive shift in money markets to price U.S. rate cuts. [FRX/] All of this leaves just about every major asset class on edge and few analysts sounding optimistic. \"So it was right not to \\'buy the dip,\\'\" said Michael Every, Rabobank\\'s senior strategist for the Asia-Pacific. The yen was last up 0.1% at 107.98. The    huddled near an 11-year low at $0.6527, while the New Zealand dollar  slipped 0.1% to $6238. The euro ( ) was up 0.3% at $1.1054. That left the   ( ) a shade weaker at 97.911. A further set of manufacturing surveys from around the world due later on Monday will provide investors more detail on the virus\\' impact on the global economy. Later in the week, central bank meetings in Australia, on Tuesday, and Canada, on Wednesday, will be closely watched. Add a Comment'], [\"By Barani Krishnan  Investing.com - How much worse could it get for oil? Crude prices took their cue from a nosediving stock market to lose up to 16% this week for the biggest weekly tumble since the Great Recession that began in 2008. That’s a known.  But pundits looking at the carnage across markets from the coronavirus epidemic are warning that it could get a lot worse for oil and other risky assets before it gets better. So, will crude prices drop to $40 a barrel? $30? Or even lower? With the first death of an American from the coronavirus expected to weigh further on U.S. markets next week - amid reports of Russia still being undecided on the production cuts required by OPEC+ - it’s hard to imagine the selloff in oil is over. Yet, oil bears may benefit from some immediate caution. While oil is down 25% on the year, two-thirds of the selloff happened in just over the last five days. The intensity of the plunge suggests that some buyback - if not at least a slowing in the decline - may happen.   If not for a technical rebound from oversold conditions, crude prices could still see some support in the coming week from the oil blockade in Iraq and potentially another positive dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. There could be OPEC jawboning too. With the cartel having its much-awaited meeting next week, it would be remiss for Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members not to talk up the market — regardless how much of a cut they ultimately agree with top ally Russia. As Herman Wang and Andrew Critchlow of energy media service Platts cautioned last week, “failure to reach an accord could put the entire OPEC+ pact at risk”. The EIA will issue its weekly supply-demand report on Wednesday. OPEC holds its members-only meeting on Thursday and talks with Russia and other allies on Friday. That’s three back-to-back days of potentially positive data and soundbites that could add $1-$2 per barrel, maybe more. Another major development that could provide a fillip to prices was Friday’s late announcement by Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell that the central bank was monitoring risks to the United States from the coronavirus, and will use “appropriate tools” to support the economy — the clearest sign yet that rate cuts were coming. The Fed’s last easing cycle ended in December after three months of back-to-back cuts of a quarter point each.  Bank of America says it expects a half point cut at the Fed’s next meeting on March 17-18. Goldman Sachs sees at least two more cuts after that through June. Despite such positives, there’s still  a possibility  that coronavirus fears could prove to be the greater factor next week, especially if there's a spike in U.S. infections or fatalities. Then Wall Street could plumb to further depths seen during the financial crisis. At that point, the question to ask is how much more could oil lose? Having set a $43.85 low on WTI this week, oil bears’ next target for the U.S. crude benchmark would be beneath the December 2018 bottom of $42.36. At Friday’s settlement of $44.76, we could be looking at a drop of another $2.50 to get below that threshold. For Brent, which sunk to $48.95, the new low to beat would be a July 2017 bottom of $46.11. Given Friday’s close of $49.67, the global crude benchmark would need to lose more than $3.50 to get to a new low. In gold’s case, the expectation is everyone’s favorite safe-haven will behave as expected in the coming week to provide the hedge investors seek from the effects of the pandemic. With world markets crashing and burning on Friday, gold was the one asset that was supposed to protect investors but failed them too.  Futures of gold and spot prices of bullion fell unexpectedly by more than 3% each as hedge funds cashed out earlier gains in the yellow metal to cover losses elsewhere. Higher margin calls imposed on gold trades also shook some longs out of the market.  From a high of nearly $1,700 per ounce at the start of the week, gold finished at below $1,560. A rebound in the coming week could return it to above $1,600. , the U.S. crude benchmark, settled down $2.33, or 5%, at $44.76 per barrel, its lowest settlement since December 2018. On a weekly basis, WTI lost 16%, its most in a week since December 14, 2008 — the era that spawned the Great Recession. , the London-traded global benchmark for crude, settled down 2.51, or 4.8%, at $49.67 per barrel, breaking the key $50 support. Brent’s session low of $48.95 was a bottom going back to July 2017. For the week, Brent was down 15%. Crude prices plunged as stocks on Wall Street succumbed to a freefall. The   was down 13% on the week, heading for its worst weekly slump since October 2008. In precious metals, gold tumbled 3.5% after higher margin calls imposed on gold traders and selling by hedge funds to cover losses elsewhere. Moody's Analytics said it expected the U.S. economy to grow by an annualized rate of 1.3% in the first quarter, down by 0.6% point because of the coronavirus. Growth for all of 2020 was seen at 1.7%, down 0.2%. Crude traders now await to see if the OPEC+ alliance of oil producers — led by Saudi Arabia and Russia - could agree by next week to cut more than one million barrels per day from global production to stop the market’s bleeding.

OPEC+ Meeting  on New York’s COMEX settled down $55.35, or 3.3%, at $1,587 per ounce, falling off the key $1,600 berth. The last time benchmark gold futures lost more in a day was in February 2018, when it slumped 4.6%. For the week in review, the contract lost 3.7%. But for the month, it managed to stay flat. , which tracks live trades in bullion, was at $1,586.16, down about 3.5% or more on both the day and week and about 0.3% lower on the month.  Gold was a safe-haven most investors piled into over the past month as tremors over the coronavirus crisis slowly built. Earlier this week, the yellow metal hit seven-year highs just short of $1,700 — raising hopes that it might have a shot later in the year at cracking the $1,900 record high. Yet, over the past four sessions, both gold futures and bullion descended into the red, before finally tumbling on Friday. Two reasons were cited by analysts: higher margin calls imposed on gold traders and selling by hedge funds to cover losses elsewhere. “Why are we not at $1,700 on gold?  That’s because hedge funds do not want a disastrous February performance and need to sell winning gold positions to counter their losing stock holdings,” said Ed Moya at New York-based online trading platform OANDA. Others exited because of higher margin calls imposed on gold trades, which meant “they need cash to stay or they need to leave”, said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management. Still, there were hopes that after Friday’s shake-out, gold would attempt a return to $1,600. “Gold should start showing signs of life regardless of what stocks do over the next couple weeks,” said Moya of OANDA.  “If panic selling with stocks continues next week, gold will likely reassert its safe-haven status or if markets show signs of stabilizing, we could see the broad-based commodity plunge ease.”   Add a Comment\"], ['By Michelle Price WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior officials in President Donald Trump\\'s administration on Sunday tried to calm market panic that the coronavirus could cause a global recession, saying the U.S. public had over-reacted and that stocks would rebound due to the American economy\\'s underlying strength. The   tumbled 11.5% last week as the virus accelerated beyond China\\'s borders, the worst weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. Roughly $4 trillion has been wiped off the value of U.S. stocks.  The selling continued when   resumed trading Sunday night, falling more than a 1%. But they later recouped initial losses on growing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve and other global central banks will take action soon to cushion the economic fallout from the epidemic.[MKTS/GLOB] Futures rose for the safe-haven U.S. 10-year Treasury note, pushing implied yields for that instrument below 1% for the first time. \"We need to see more of a peak panic before investors are convinced it\\'s time to go in,\" Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE: ), said on Sunday, adding that a recovery in the 10-year yield would be a gauge of steadying sentiment. Economists have begun to worry that the losses could soon start to weigh on consumer spending even before the virus becomes widespread in the United States. U.S. financial regulators who will gather on Wednesday face their most challenging week in a decade. One official told Reuters that the coming days will determine whether the federal government must take measures to bolster market confidence. Speaking to NBC\\'s \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration\\'s response to the virus, said that the market \"will come back.\" \"The fundamentals of this economy are strong. We just saw some new numbers come out in housing and consumer confidence and business optimism. Unemployment is at a 50-year low. More Americans are working than ever before,\" Pence said. On Friday afternoon, Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell sought also to quell fears, stoked by dire economic data from China, flagging that the central bank would take action if necessary to support the economy, which he said remained strong. Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has pressed his view that the risk to the American people from the virus remains \"very low\" even as he has faced Democratic criticism that his administration had bungled its response to the outbreak. When asked on the \"Fox News Sunday\" program if the American people are over-reacting to the current threat, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar responded, \"Yes, absolutely.\" The World Health Organization\\'s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus likewise told CNBC on Sunday that the market panic was uncalled for, even after the organization on Friday raised its threat assessment for the virus to its highest level.  \"Global markets ... should calm down and try to see the reality,\" he said.  The fast-spreading virus has infected around 85,000 people in 53 countries. China, the world\\'s second-largest economy and epicenter of the outbreak, is home to the vast majority of cases. About 70 have been diagnosed in the United States.  A Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health conditions was the first American to die from the virus, officials said Saturday. Writing on Twitter late on Saturday, Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz (DE: ), said reassuring words may not be enough to stem the rout, given the negative news.  \"Absent anything else, I worry that this may still tip net negative\" on Monday trading resumption, he wrote. BUSINESSES REACTION The rapid spread of the virus has led businesses globally to restrict travel, send workers home and cancel conferences, hitting stocks in the aviation, gambling, tourism and luxury goods sectors. That disruption to global supply chains and productivity has darkened the outlook for a world economy already struggling with the fallout of the U.S.-China trade war. So far, the outbreak\\'s biggest measurable effect has been in China, but a purchasing managers survey last month signaled it was beginning to hit U.S. businesses. Another batch of U.S. economic indicators due out early this week will be closely watched for evidence of a growing impact. Investors now fully expect the Fed to respond with interest rate cuts this month. Questions remain over how far the Fed would cut and what more officials there and at other central banks can do beyond lowering borrowing costs already at rock-bottom levels for more than a decade. In a blog post on Sunday, Washington trade group the Bank Policy Institute, said the Fed could explore additional measures to stimulate credit, including cutting the deposits banks must hold on reserve with the Fed and increasing the availability of liquidity through its discount window.  For a graphic on U.S. stocks have fallen hard: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/2676/2641/Pasted%20Image.jpg Pence said the U.S. government is doing \"everything possible\" to prevent the virus from spreading and that he is \"confident\" the United States is prepared.  Azar said that during a meeting of the White House\\'s coronavirus task force on Saturday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had discussed the negative stock market reaction, saying that much of it was driven by uncertainty. Azar said the administration aimed to quell that uncertainty by being as transparent as possible about latest developments. \"That\\'s why we are trying to give the American people all the information we have when we have it so they don\\'t think there\\'s secret information they\\'re not getting,\" Azar said.

Wall Street strategists have been slashing forecasts as the impact from the virus is set to be felt far further than the first quarter, putting 2020 profit growth in jeopardy. A week previous, many market watchers said they expected the virus to affect earnings in the first quarter but not much beyond that. Worries about the expected impact escalated last week as the virus, which was first detected in China spread rapidly to countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran, causing the S&P 500 ( ) to suffer its biggest weekly drop since the 2008 global financial crisis. In the United States, New York\\'s governor confirmed his state\\'s first positive case on Sunday. \"This is easily going to spill over into the second quarter,\" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"There isn\\'t a day that goes by now without half a dozen companies expecting some sort of negative effect.\"  (NYSE: ) equity strategist Tobias Levkovich is forecasting a slight fall year-over-year in 2020 earnings with the impact occurring in the first half of the year as production disruptions emerge and travel is hammered.  However, if it triggered a global recession, profits could \"decline near 25% and equity markets fall similarly as stocks typically track earnings given past patterns when downturns occurred,\" Levkovich wrote.  On Thursday, strategists from Goldman Sachs (N: ) said they now expect zero profit growth for S&P 500 companies in 2020.  After a lackluster year of profit growth in 2019, many investors had been hoping earnings this year would be strong enough to support further market gains. To be sure, part of the recent steep sell-off in stocks has been because of the warnings from companies including market heavyweight Apple Inc (O: ). Wall Street\\'s consensus earnings forecasts, which are based on estimates from analysts who cover individual companies, have come down as well, but mostly not as much as some of the forecasts from the banks. Howard Silverblatt, analyst at S&P   Jones Indices, noted that first-quarter profit estimates have declined 5.0% since the end of December, and more declines are expected, as approximately 100 companies have warned. Based on IBES data from Refinitiv, the 2020 consensus profit forecast from analysts is still well above zero. As of Friday, analysts were expecting earnings growth of 7.6% for 2020, down from an estimate of 9.7% at the start of the year, while for the first quarter, analysts expect a 2.7% gain in earnings versus a year ago, down from 6.3% on Jan. 1, according to Refinitiv\\'s data. While first-quarter estimates have further to fall as more companies give negative guidance, zero earnings growth for the full year is unlikely, said Nick Raich, chief executive of The Earnings Scout, an independent research firm, anticipating some rebound in corporate results once the spread of the virus slows and demand picks back up. Many investors noted that the fast-changing outlook for the economy and earnings makes the virus a longer-term issue. \"This is going to be a full-year event,\" Tuz said.

Short sellers - who hope to profit by selling borrowed shares and buying them back later at a lower price - logged a one-week paper profit of $104.77 billion in the last week of February, according to data from financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners measuring bets against U.S.-listed stocks and American Depositary Receipts. That compares with $3.25 billion in paper profits in the prior week. That upside came during a week marked by furious selling of everything from stocks to a broad range of currencies and eventually, some popular safe-haven assets like gold. All three major U.S. indexes registered their largest weekly declines since 2008, with the S&P 500 ( ) falling 11.5%. The tumble in stocks has marked a long-awaited reversal for bearish investors, many of whom had seen their portfolios bruised by the market\\' relentless march higher last year, when the S&P gained 29%. The S&P was up 2.7% on Monday. Though few, if any, could have named the coronavirus as a major threat to markets going into 2020, short sellers have long railed against stock valuations they perceived as being out of line with fundamentals and other excesses that have cropped up during the more than decade-long bull market. \"The run-up in the last fall was ridiculous. And there was a lot of cheerleading going on,\" said Brad Lamensdorf, a portfolio manager at Ranger Alternative Management. His fund\\'s short position has dropped to about 85% after Lamensdorf took profits on various bets against stocks, from being short 99% of his portfolio going into the year, he said. The week\\'s declines afforded Andrew Left of Citron Capital the opportunity to profitably close a long-held bet against online retailer Wayfair (N: ) on Friday. It was a position he had maintained for four years. Wayfair shares dropped 21% last week amid the broad market selloff. The sell-off has also helped Left profit from a bet against Tesla Inc\\'s (O: ) shares. The electric car company\\'s shares, which had more than doubled in price this year through Feb 21, fell 26% last week. Yet the markets have not entirely spared Left\\'s portfolio, which also includes long positions, or bets on certain stocks to move higher. \"My shorts have gone down, which is nice. My longs have gone down, which is not so nice,\" Left said. \"What I am hoping is that when the market does stabilize, at whatever level, my longs will be more resilient.\" The market tumble is also likely to be a boon for \"black swan\" funds - hedge funds that position themselves for big market dislocations sparked by unforeseen events. \"Risk management is not about timing, it is about contingency planning. Our clients were extremely well prepared,\" Mark Spitznagel, the founder of Universa Investments, said in a statement. Among its strategies, the firm uses far out-of-the-money \"put\" options on individual stocks and broader markets, designed to explode in value when markets experience a sharp fall. The window for short-selling gains may be a small one. Historically, big market drops have more often been brief, violent events that have been followed by rebounds. The S&P 500 has notched weekly declines of 10% or more only 14 times in its history, and those drops have been followed by an average weekly gain of 3.5%, data from Bespoke Investment showed. It is a fact that\\'s not lost on short sellers like Lamensdorf. \"We\\'re getting a little cash as this thing gets overdone because when the bounce comes, it\\'s pretty brutal for a short seller,\" he said.

Against the backdrop of rising infections in the U.S., the Federal Reserve delivered a surprise half-a-point rate cut on Tuesday, taking its benchmark rate to 1% to 1.25%.

While acknowledging the Fed move will have no impact on the transmission of the virus or impact on supply chains, he said the cut will have a meaningful impact to the economy. “The Fed panicked which they\\'re very good at doing and it was a mistake,\" said Michael O\\'Rourke, a strategist with Jones Trading in Stamford, Connecticut. \"The Fed cutting rates by 50 basis points now is not going to get people to go to the movies or to conferences, sporting events or any large gatherings.\" The U.S. central bank cut rates three times in 2019 and has since held the fire amid signs of improving growth after the striking of a \"Phase One\" trade deal between the United States and China.

The S&P 500 ( ) tumbled 11.5% last week before staging a partial rebound on Monday on hopes central banks will seek to ease the economic impact of the epidemic through rate cuts. On Friday alone the market turned over 19.35 billion shares, the second highest amount on record behind 19.76 billion on Oct. 10, 2008, said Larry Tabb, founder of research and consultancy firm Tabb Group.

The U.S. markets are highly automated, with millions of messages processed each second, and much of last week\\'s move was likely computer-driven, led by professional traders, said Ben Carlson, director of institutional asset management at Ritholtz Wealth Management. He said he did not notice any major flash crash-type price spikes or major discrepancies between exchange-traded fund prices and the prices of their underlying constituents. Kinahan noted two instances of possible panic selling at the market close on Thursday or Friday, but those may have been due in part to large derivatives positions being unwound. TMX Group (TO: ), Canada\\'s largest exchange operator, shut down its venues two hours earlier than normal on Friday due to capacity issues. And Robinhood, the free trading app popular with young investors, experienced a system-wide outage on Monday as stock prices rebounded, according to CNBC.

All three major U.S. stock market indexes dropped more than 3% after the Fed\\'s first emergency rate cut since the 2008 financial crisis.  The rate reduction underscored the Fed\\'s concern about the coronavirus that has spread around the world after emerging late last year in China. It came two weeks ahead of a scheduled policy meeting, where traders had fully priced in a 50 basis point cut. Stocks had initially jumped more than 1%, but then dropped as traders worried whether pumping more money into financial markets would address the central problem - a drop in business activity as workers and consumers stay home. \"The rate cut underscores the magnitude of the problem that the global economy is facing,\" said Peter Kenny, founder of Kenny\\'s Commentary LLC and Strategic Board Solutions LLC in New York. \"Normally, markets would welcome a rate cut, and they were hoping for it.

Add a Comment'], ['By Jason Lange WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The search for a Democrat to challenge Republican U.S. President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election narrowed on Wednesday to a choice between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, who staged a comeback in voting Super Tuesday to become the undisputed standard-bearer of the party\\'s moderate wing. In an unexpectedly strong showing, former Vice President Biden was set to win 10 of the 14 states up for grabs on Tuesday, including the major prize of Texas. He stormed ahead in the overall tally of delegates who will choose a presidential nominee at the Democratic convention in July.  His strong performance ended leftist U.S. Senator Sanders\\' status as the Democratic front-runner and forced former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg out of the race altogether. Bloomberg on Wednesday abandoned his presidential campaign and endorsed Biden, after spending hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money on ads across the United States. But he failed to deliver convincing results on Tuesday, the biggest day of voting in the Democratic nomination campaign with contests in 14 states across the country.  \"A viable path to the nomination no longer exists,\" Bloomberg, 78, said in a statement. Endorsing Biden, Bloomberg said: \"I will work to make him the next president of the United States.\"  The media billionaire did not say whether he would spend part of his fortune to help Biden, but Bloomberg\\'s absence from the race will help the former vice president. Both men appeal to the centrist wing of the Democratic Party. In a tweet addressed to Bloomberg, Biden wrote, \"I can’t thank you enough for your support—and for your tireless work on everything from gun safety reform to climate change. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It’s about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we’re gonna do it.\"  Sanders, a democratic socialist who is popular with young voters, lashed out at what he said was \"the kind of venom we’re seeing from some in the corporate media,\" and attempted to draw a stark contrast between himself and Biden. \"What this campaign, I think, is increasingly about is: Which side are you on?\" Sanders told a news conference in Vermont. He attacked Biden’s record voting in favor of trade deals that he says had devastated parts of the Midwest, Biden’s votes in favor of the Iraq war and a bankruptcy bill, and his past record on Social Security. In another move that could reshape the race, Elizabeth Warren, 70, is \"talking to her team to assess the path forward,\" a campaign aide said.  The liberal U.S. senator, who was seeking to become the nation\\'s first female president, had disappointing results across the board on Tuesday, including coming in third in her home state of Massachusetts. A resurgent Biden, 77, rolled to electoral victories across the South, Midwest and New England, setting up a one-on-one battle against Sanders, who won three states and led in California. Biden, whose campaign had been on life support just weeks ago, registered surprise victories in Texas and Massachusetts.  U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday as investors cheered Biden\\'s good night. Healthcare stocks provided the biggest boost as Sanders and his \"Medicare for All\" proposal, which would eliminate private health insurance, looked less likely to become a reality. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) was up 3.33% and the S&P 500 ( ) gained 2.87%, rising for only the second time in 10 days after being battered by fears about the coronavirus outbreak. \"For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign,\" Biden told roaring supporters in Los Angeles. \"We are very much alive!\"  Until a week ago, Biden had trailed Sanders in most state and national opinion polls.  Biden argues that after two terms by President Barack Obama\\'s side and decades as a U.S. senator, he has the experience both to beat Trump and then run the country. He has promised greater access to healthcare and to mend relations with traditional U.S. allies in Europe that were frayed by Trump\\'s \"America First\" foreign policy. Sanders wants to establish a free universal healthcare system and eliminate private health insurance, forgive student loan debt and enact the \"Green New Deal\" of sweeping economic policies to fight climate change.  If Warren drops out, Sanders might benefit from some of her supporters shifting to him. In an email to her campaign staff, Warren’s campaign manager, Roger Lau, offered a sobering assessment of Super Tuesday, just three weeks after he said internal projections showed she would finish in the top two in eight states. Warren, he said, would “take time right now to think through the right way to continue this fight.” Sanders said he had spoken to Warren over the phone on Wednesday.  \"Elizabeth Warren is a very, very excellent senator, she has run a strong campaign. She\\'ll make her own decision in her own time,\" Sanders told a news conference in Vermont.  Trump said Sanders would have done better on Tuesday if Warren had dropped out of the race beforehand and backed him. \"Had Warren endorsed Bernie, we would have had a different story now,” he told reporters in the White House. Tallies after Tuesday showed Biden leading Sanders in delegates overall by 433 to 388. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to win the Democratic nomination on the first ballot at the July convention. In Tuesday\\'s biggest upset, Biden was projected by Edison Research to have won Texas, the largest prize after California. Sanders invested heavily in Texas and was counting on its Latino voters to propel him to victory. Sanders, the onetime front-runner who had hoped to take a big step toward the nomination on Tuesday, won Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont, Edison Research said.  Biden, with overwhelming support from African-American, moderate and older voters, swept to wins in Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. The Associated Press on Wednesday projected Biden to win Maine.  Fox News and the AP projected Sanders winning California, where 415 delegates are up for grabs. By Wednesday afternoon, Sanders was ahead by 8.7 percentage points with almost 87% of precincts reporting.

An increasing number of people faced a new reality as many were asked to stay home from work, schools were closed, large gatherings and events were canceled, stores cleared of staples like toiletries and water, and face masks became a common sight. The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations, with six countries reporting their first cases on Friday. The virus has radiated across the United States, surfacing in at least four new states plus San Francisco.  More than 2,000 people were stranded on the Grand Princess cruise ship after it was barred from returning to port in San Francisco because at least 35 people aboard developed flu-like symptoms. Test kits were delivered at sea to the vessel. Moves by some major economies including the United States to cut interest rates and pledge billions of dollars to fight the epidemic have done little to allay fears about the spread of the disease and the economic fallout, with supply chains crippled around the world, especially in China. In New York, JPMorgan (N: ) divided its team between central locations and a secondary site in New Jersey while Goldman Sachs (N: ) sent some traders to nearby secondary offices in Greenwich, Connecticut and Jersey City. In London, Europe\\'s financial capital, the Canary Wharf district was unusually quiet.

Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL: ), the hardest-hit stock among European carriers, lost more than quarter of its market value on Friday and has fallen almost 70% since the start of February. U.S. stock index futures dropped sharply over fears about the epidemic, which has prompted a sharp cut to global economic growth forecasts for 2020. The benchmark S&P 500 ( ) looked set to close out the week more than 10% below its record-high close on Feb. 19. \"If this really ramps up, we could see a lot more kitchen-sinking updates from the travel industry and airlines,\" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG. \"What\\'s impressive about the current move is it probably understates the degree of disruption we could be facing across the U.S. and Europe.\" Yields on long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds fell to record lows, while gold was on course for its biggest weekly gain since 2011 as investors fled to assets seen as safe havens.

U.S. stocks are down sharply from the record highs they reached in late February as companies ranging from Apple Inc (O: ) to Tesla Inc (O: ) warn investors their supply chains and revenues could be derailed by the rapidly spreading virus known as COVID-19.  As a result, fund managers from firms including   (N: ), GMO, Madison Investors and Needham & Company say they are looking at companies in the healthcare, technology and financial services sectors which could continue to gain market share regardless of any economic disruptions from the outbreak. \"We felt that we were due for a correction, we just didn\\'t know what would trigger it, and when it would begin,\" said Chris Retzler, portfolio manager of the Needham Small Cap Growth fund.  \"I don\\'t know how low we go and how long we stay there, but I still remain firmly of the belief that we are in a bull market,\" said Retzler, adding that he was actively adding to companies during the market sell-off. Retzler is focusing his portfolio on companies that can benefit from the growth of 5G communications, military modernization and data security, among other areas. He also remains bullish on healthcare companies, which saw share prices decline earlier this year on concerns that Bernie Sanders, a self-avowed democratic socialist senator from Vermont, could win the Democratic presidential nomination and push a Medicare for All plan.  \"We have healthcare investments where we think that names are misunderstood, and we think the opportunities are great but are taking a little bit longer to excite investors,\" Retzler said.  Mike Smith, portfolio manager of the Wells Fargo Endeavor Select fund, said he reserves a portion of his portfolio to focus on companies with compelling valuations and has been more active in the last week about adding to healthcare and technology names.  Among the more recent additions to his portfolio is   Inc (O: ), a medical device company that makes continuous monitoring devices for patients with diabetes. Shares of the company are up nearly 32% for the year to date through March 5, while the broad   is down slightly more than 5% over the same time.  \"We\\'re trying to find those companies that are impervious to what\\'s going on right now,\" Smith said.  Matt Hayner, portfolio manager of the Madison Investors fund, began buying shares of Becton Dickinson and Co (N: ), a maker of medical supplies and devices, in January. The company, whose shares have dropped about 11% year to date, now represents about 4% of Hayner\\'s portfolio. \"Even in the face of economic disruption, people will still need healthcare and maybe even more so with a disease traversing the globe that ultimately hospitalizes people,\" he said.  NEW \\'QUALITY\\' STOCKS The annual Lipper Fund Awards granted by Refinitiv, formerly the financial and risk business of Thomson Reuters, recognize the top funds and fund management firms in more than 20 countries based on risk-adjusted returns. Winners were announced on March 5 in New York.  The market risks from the coronavirus outbreak should \"burn themselves out\" within the next two quarters, setting up a rebound in the shares of companies that have seen sharp declines, said Tom Hancock, portfolio manager of the GMO Quality fund.  Hancock added a new position in a healthcare company to his portfolio last week and built up a new position in ride-hailing firm   Inc (O: ) over the last two quarters after the company\\'s \"broken\" initial public offering left its shares trading at an attractive valuation, he said.  Hancock is now focused on companies that can grow regardless of the economic impact of the coronavirus, he said.  \"We still have concerns that are stopping us from going out and buying absolutely everything,\" Hancock said. He said he was focusing on giant technology companies like Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O: ) and Apple Inc which have what he called \"natural monopolies.\" Shares of both companies are down about 5% over the last month.  \"If you say high quality stocks, people think of names like Procter and Gamble and   (NYSE: ),\" Hancock said. \"But we think the new quality stocks are the technology stocks that have very low capital requirements and operate winner-take-all business models.\"      Add a Comment'], ['By Geoffrey Smith\\xa0 Investing.com --\\xa0U.S. stocks tumbled again at the opening Friday as the number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus topped 100,000.

Trump signed the legislation at the end of a week in which the virus began to disrupt daily life for many Americans. As stocks plunge and U.S. companies grapple with the economic fallout, his administration is also weighing tax relief for the cruise, travel and airline industries, according to a source familiar with the plan.  In Seattle, the epicenter of the nation\\'s outbreak, there were school closures and orders to work from home. In Miami and Baltimore, areas less affected by the outbreak, music festivals and sporting events were canceled or curtailed as a precaution. More than a third of the new funds will be spent on test kits and research and development into vaccines and treatments. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the respiratory illness, which emerged in China and has spread to more than 90 nations, killing more than 3,400 people and infecting more than 100,000 worldwide.  Six countries reported their first cases on Friday.  \"We\\'re doing very well,\" Trump said after signing the spending bill, which was approved by the Senate on Thursday. \"But it\\'s an unforeseen problem ... came out of nowhere, but we\\'re taking care of it.\" Trump was due to travel later on Friday to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. Americans are sharply divided over the dangers of the new coronavirus, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Critics of Trump, including Democratic lawmakers, have accused the president of downplaying the significance of the outbreak for political reasons. He has said the risk to Americans is low. A union representing tens of thousands of U.S. government employees on Friday called on the Trump administration to take the coronavirus seriously for federal workers, especially those working in areas directly impacted by the outbreak.  Washington\\'s King County has been the hardest hit area in the United States with at least a dozen deaths, several of whom were people living at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland.

Test results of passengers were due on Friday, according to Mary Ellen Carroll, executive director of San Francisco’s Department of Emergency Management.

Amid emergency rate cuts, record Dow point gains, OPEC standoffs and ever-shrinking yields, there’s plenty investors may have missed. Here are three things that flew under the radar this week. In a week filled with uncertainty and wild swings, one thing looked certain: the market wants rates cut to the bone. The surprise 50-basis-point cut from the FOMC just made investors hungrier for cheaper money. Market chatter focused on the March meeting, but looking way down the line the fed funds futures are predicting President Donald Trump might get his wish. Trump wants negative interest rates, like those of the European Central Bank. The ECB cut rates to negative 0.5% last September and restarted asset purchases. That looks like a great deal to Trump, who said at Davos getting “paid to borrow money” is something he “could get used to very quickly.” And he’s been pushing the Fed, tweeting last September as the ECB cut that the “Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt.” \\n', ' Now the market thinks that’s (slightly) possible. As of Friday there was a 7% chance U.S. rates would be in negative territory, according to Investing.com’s  . Rates aren’t the only thing with a minus sign. The   as a whole is looking at a decline in earnings in the first quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago, according to FactSet. “Over the past week, the aggregate earnings growth rate for Q1 2020 changed from slight year-over-year earnings growth on February 28 (+0.5%) to a slight year-over-year earnings decline today (-0.1%),” the financial data and research company said. Among the sectors, materials are seen having the biggest profit drop, down 16.6%, with industrials next, off 14.2% and consumer discretionary down 10.4%. Last week, Goldman Sachs said it predicted no growth for U.S. company earnings for all of 2020, with its model incorporating “the likelihood that the virus becomes widespread.” Jerome Powell and Co. aren’t just working on softening the economic impact of Covid-19. It’s looking to keep the disease itself from spreading. The Fed is quarantining physical U.S. dollars coming back to the country from Asia. Regional Fed banks will keep the repatriated greenbacks out of circulation for seven to 10 days before moving the cash back into circulation. According to the CDC, it “may be possible” to transmit the virus through objects that have had direct contact with it, but person-to-person contact is the main means of spreading the disease. As the global reserve currency, U.S. dollars are the most widely distributed notes in the world with around $1.75 trillion worth of cash in circulation globally, according to the Fed. Much that is circulated overseas, particularly in Asia where the dollar is often stronger than local currencies.

The good news: Past geopolitical events have typically seen the S&P 500 ( ) take three weeks to bottom and another three weeks to recover to prior levels,   (DE: ) strategists said in a report that examined 29 past incidents of geopolitically driven market volatility. That list includes the 9/11 attacks, the first Gulf War and Britain\\'s vote to exit the European Union, but not market-driven events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bubble. The 2020 selloff, which started on Feb. 19, is also far deeper than many prior episodes of volatility the bank studied: As of afternoon trade on Monday, the S&P 500 had already fallen more than 17% from its Feb. 19 closing high. By comparison, the median size of the selloff in the bank\\'s analysis was 6.3%. That includes a nearly 16% decline around the first Gulf War, a 5.6% drop on Brexit worries and a nearly 26% tumble after Germany attacked France in 1940. \"We see parallels between the virus outbreak and geopolitical shocks in that both entail potentially large but difficult to quantify risks,\" Deutsche Bank strategists Binky Chadha, Parag Thatte and Srineel Jalagani said in an analysis last week. Still, analysts at the bank cautioned that the “uniqueness” of the coronavirus outbreak means there is no single playbook that easily fits the current situation. Uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus’ trajectory and uneven responses to the outbreak around the world have hampered investors’ ability to determine its economic damage and further impact on asset prices. Monday’s oil price shock on the heels of Saudi-Russian supply tensions further clouded forecasts and added a new dimension to the selloff in equities, with the S&P 500 triggering a trading halt as it fell 7% after the open. (GRAPHIC: Geopolitical events and stock selloffs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/USA-STOCKS/0H001R8FFC7Z/eikon.png) Stretched valuations on the heels of a 30% gain in 2019 may also be helping to exaggerate downside moves during the latest pullback, the bank’s strategists said. Of the geopolitical events tracked in the report, stocks showed a median recovery of 14.1%, a year after the bottom. But they were not always higher a year later, especially during events that coincided with recessions, such as the 9/11 attacks. The strategists also noted that the current selloff has similarities with pullbacks associated with spikes in volatility. In such events, stocks took twice as long to bottom compared with those linked to geopolitical events and saw sharper median selloffs.

The sell-off began over the weekend when an oil supply pact between Saudi Arabia and Russia collapsed and both countries vowed to hike production amid weakening global demand due to the coronavirus and signs of an economic slowdown. Oil prices crashed to their lowest since the 1991 Gulf war, with Brent crude futures ( ) closing down 23.88% and front-month WTI falling 25.1%, sending the S&P Energy index ( ) sliding 20.1%, its largest one-day drop on record. Global markets were already on edge as worldwide confirmed cases of COVID-19 surged past 110,000, causing widespread supply disruption and large-scale quarantine measures as governments scramble to contain the outbreak.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly played down the threat posed by the flu-like virus sweeping the globe, was planning to meet with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other members of his economic team to weigh possible action, an administration official told Reuters. Paid sick leave is among policy steps being considered, the official said on condition of anonymity. One camp in the White House, which includes Trump, backs an across-the-board payroll tax cut, said an economist advising the administration, while top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and others advocate specific tax credits, loans or direct subsidies to certain industries or hard-hit areas. Florida health officials said all people returning from China, Iran, South Korea and Italy must isolate for 14 days while travelers from other countries affected by the outbreak should monitor their health. The number of confirmed U.S. cases reached 566, including 22 deaths, according to state public health authorities and a running national tally kept by the Johns Hopkins University. Thirty-four U.S. states and the District of Columbia have reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) infections of the respiratory illness COVID-19 that can lead to pneumonia. Louisiana had the state\\'s first presumed coronavirus case, Governor John Bel Edwards announced on Monday. U.S. stock markets, which have sold off in the past two weeks on fears the outbreak would push the global economy into a recession, plummeted on Monday, triggering a brief trading halt on the New York Stock Exchange. The benchmark S&P 500 ( ) index was down almost 8% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) shed more than 7%. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, said the plunge suggested investors lacked confidence in the administration\\'s coronavirus battle plan. Trump, who often points to the stock market as a gauge of his economic record, criticized news media organizations\\' coverage of the outbreak in a tweet and accused Democrats of hyping the situation \"far beyond what the facts would warrant.\"  The Republican president did not have any coronavirus-related events on his schedule heading into Monday despite growing signs the outbreak was disrupting the economy and the lives of millions of Americans. The CDC advised colleges and universities to consider asking students studying abroad to return home and cancel or postpone upcoming travel. New Jersey\\'s Princeton University, one of the nation\\'s most prestigious universities, will move to virtual instruction after its spring break later this month and decrease the number of gatherings on campus, its president announced.  Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health, and other health officials say older Americans, especially those with chronic medical concerns, should avoid big social gatherings, cruise ships and airline flights. Warnings from Fauci and others about the need for greater \"social distancing\" - the practice of minimizing unnecessary contact in public settings - came amid a high-profile example of risks now inherent in large gatherings. U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and U.S. Representative Paul Gosar announced over the weekend they would self-quarantine after coming in contact at a conservative political conference with an attendee who later tested positive for the virus. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the administration\\'s overall response to the crisis, also attended the conference. The White House said there was no indication they came into contact with the infected attendee.  CRUISE SHIP  More than 110,000 people have been infected and about 3,800 have died in the outbreak, which originated in China late last year and has spread to at least 105 countries and territories. Italy, which has the second-highest death toll, has sealed off much of its wealthy industrial north in an effort to contain spread of the virus. The hardest-hit place in the United States has been a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, and Washington state is considering mandatory measures such as banning large gatherings but not necessarily imposing massive quarantines. The Life Care Center facility has accounted for most of the 18 confirmed coronavirus-related deaths in Washington state. In California, officials planned to offload 2,400 passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship, which was barred from returning to San Francisco last week due to a coronavirus outbreak on board. Most of the passengers will go into quarantine at four military bases across the country, with those requiring immediate medical attention heading to hospitals. The crew of 1,100 will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, unless they are in need of acute care off the vessel. California has more than 100 confirmed cases, while on the East Coast, cases in New York state rose to 142, up from 105 a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday. One of them was Rick Cotton, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey that controls airports and other major travel hubs. He will be quarantined and work from home, Cuomo said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked employers in the nation\\'s most populous city to consider staggering workers\\' start times to ease crowding on public transport and to allow more telecommuting where possible. De Blasio said there were 20 confirmed cases there as of Monday afternoon.

Italy\\'s markets are sure to come under fire after the government ordered a lockdown of large parts of the north of the country, including the financial capital Milan. There were also worries that U.S. oil producers that had issued a lot of debt would be made uneconomic by the price drop. Not helping the mood was news North Korea had fired three projectiles off its eastern coast on Monday. \"After a week when the stockpiling of bonds, credit protection and toilet paper became a thing, let\\'s hope we start to see some more clarity on the reaction,\" said Martin Whetton, head of bond & rates strategy at CBA. \"Dollar bloc central banks cut policy rates by 125 basis points, not as a way to stop a viral pandemic, but to stem a fear pandemic,\" he added, while noting many had little scope to ease further. BOND BUBBLE A tectonic shift saw markets  fully price in an easing of 75 basis points from the Fed on March 18, while a cut to near zero was now seen as likely by April. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday and will be under intense pressure to act, but rates there are already deeply negative. \"The onus is falling, perhaps inevitably on the actions of governments to abandon budget surpluses and reinvigorate the demand side of the economy,\" said Whetton. Urgent action was clearly needed with data suggesting the global economy toppled into recession this quarter. Figures out from China over the weekend showed exports fell 17.2% in January-February, from a year earlier. Analysts at BofA Global Research estimated the latest sell-off had seen $9 trillion in global equity value vaporised in nine days, while the average 10-year yield in the developed world hit 16 basis points, the lowest in 120 years. \"The clearest outcome of the exogenous COVID-19 shock is a collapse in bond yields, which once panic fades can induce huge rotation to \\'growth stocks\\' and \\'bond proxies\\' in equities,\" they wrote in a client note.

Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a morning note that this would be of limited benefit, given that it would offer no relief to gig economy workers, whose numbers have expanded massively in recent years. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said on Monday that the measures would be targeted at small businesses and those most exposed to the economic impact of the virus.

Officials with Detroit automakers General Motors Co (N: ),   (N: ) and   Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI: ) (N: ) on Wednesday said there has been no disruption to U.S. production.  Automakers and their suppliers have avoided shutdowns in the United States so far due to parts already en route, as well as suppliers resorting to air shipments or resourcing the supply of parts to different plants, supplier executives and industry consultants said. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said last week the No. 1 U.S. automaker\\'s vehicle production was secure from parts shortages \"quite far into this month.\" Suppliers and industry consultants contacted by Reuters echoed that there should be no issues through at least the end of the month.  The coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19, has killed more than 4,300 globally and been reported in about 120 countries. In Wednesday trading, shares of GM and Ford fell 4.1% and 5.5%, respectively, on a day when the broad S&P 500 Index ( ) fell nearly 5%. Kalitta Air, an international air cargo carrier in Michigan that counts auto companies among its clients, is operating its planes 25% more than usual due to heavier demand from customers and the near-term schedule is filled, said Chief Operating Officer Pete Sanderlin. \"We\\'re booking business towards the end of April.\" Suppliers echo that sentiment. \"Dana hasn’t had any significant interruptions up to this point, and we have 149 facilities globally,\" Dana Inc (N: ) CEO James Kamsickas said in an email statement.  However, that situation could change quickly for suppliers and their customers, said Dan Hearsch, managing director in the auto practice for consultancy AlixPartners. \"You need all 9,000 parts that go into a car. If you only have 8,998 of them, you\\'re got a problem. You can\\'t make the car,\" he said.  Meanwhile, analysts are reducing their 2020 sales forecasts for the U.S. market due to the outbreak.  (NYSE: ) analyst Adam Jonas said on Wednesday in a research note he expects the outbreak to send U.S. auto sales down 9% this year as \"demand shock\" causes consumers to delay large purchases. Before the outbreak, he had expected a decline of 1-2%.  Jonas cut price targets on GM and Ford, as well as on publicly traded dealer groups AutoNation Inc (N: ),   (N: ),   (N: ) and   (N: ). He also trimmed his 2020 profit forecasts for GM and Ford.  However, auto dealers from across the United States said last week it was business as usual with strong customer traffic in their showrooms, and the situation had not changed so far this week.  \"Thankfully, we are well. Nothing has changed with our dealers with respect to the coronavirus,\" Evelyn Cardenas, CEO of the Central Florida Auto Dealers Association in the Orlando area said on Tuesday. Those sentiments were echoed by the National Automobile Dealers Association. While sales data from J.D.

It was down $12.05, or almost 27%, on the week. “There was an oil surplus before the coronavirus and there is now even more of that surplus, not only because the demand gets lower every day but also because the supply is getting larger too,” said\\xa0Igor Windisch of the IBW Oil Brief. “So this crash is not panic, it is pure logic – and this is the only reassuring fact, really.” Oil’s bottom fell out on Friday after market titans Saudi Arabia and Russia resolved not to cut to production anymore and instead sell as much of their crude as possible at lower prices to grab share from a rapidly declining market amid the coronavirus crisis.

To put the reduction into context, Rystad Energy’s pre-coronavirus estimate was for an average of 200,000 flights per day this year, the analysts said. “Oil prices are about to get uglier,” said Ed Moya of online trading platform OANDA. “As the Saudis and Russians ramp up production, a key super-contango threshold has been reached, suggesting another plunge is upon us.” Contango refers to a situation in commodities where the front-month contract in a particular market trades at a discount to farther months for delivery.\\xa0 In Brent’s case, crude for immediate delivery fell on Thursday to a discount of about $10 a barrel compared with the same crude for delivery in one year’s time. Such a market dynamic allows traders to buy crude immediately, put it in storage somewhere, and try and make a gain by selling it forward. While that may be lucrative for the individual, the oil sitting in storage shows up as part of global inventories, further depressing the spot price.

Rate options are implying a 26% probability that the key federal funds rate will go below zero by the end of December, according to BofA Securities data, citing short expiry options on one-year U.S. swap rates late on Wednesday. That compares with a 5% probability in early January. The options measure the expected near-term movements of rates on interest rate swaps, derivatives that are sensitive to monetary policy expectations and used by investors to express views on where borrowing costs will go. \"Given the diminishing Fed toolkit, you always have to assign some probability to a negative interest rate policy\" to fight the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, said Bruno Braizinha, interest rates strategist at BofA Securities in New York. The Fed funds rate has ranged from 1.0% to 1.25% after the central bank delivered a rare 50-basis point rate cut last week between regular meetings. It has never gone below the 0% to 0.25% band, and Fed officials have said they oppose negative rates, which have had mixed results in Europe and Japan.

The former vice president\\'s afternoon address came a little more than 16 hours after Trump made his own national address from the White House and was intended to give Americans a glimpse of how he would handle an international crisis as president. Trump announced a 30-day ban on travel to the United States from continental Europe on Wednesday night and promised economic stimulus measures, vowing to contain the pandemic. But already battered global financial markets plunged again on Thursday. U.S. stock indexes were down more than 7% in afternoon trading, confirming Wall Street is in a bear market.  Biden has taken control of the two-way nominating battle between him and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont after winning at least four of six states in primary contests on Tuesday. Sanders was planning to make his own speech later on Thursday afternoon to address the coronavirus outbreak. In a harsh critique of the administration\\'s response, Biden simultaneously attacked Trump for the actions he has taken while blaming him for not doing more to face the growing crisis. Noting that Trump had called it a \"foreign virus\" on Wednesday, Biden warned against \"xenophobia\" and said the coronavirus \"does not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or ZIP code.\" \"Banning all travel from Europe or any other part of the world may slow it, but as we have seen, it will not stop it,\" Biden added. \"We have to help the world to drive coordinated global strategy, not shut ourselves off from the world.\" Biden also laid out his own plan for dealing with the outbreak, including emergency paid sick leave for workers and widely available free testing for the virus, saying the number of tests should number in the \"millions, not the thousands.\" The Trump administration has been criticized for failing to produce enough tests to meet demand. In response, the Trump campaign defended the president\\'s actions and accused Biden in a statement of trying to \"capitalize politically and stoke citizens\\' fears.\" The crisis continued to reshape the contours of the presidential campaign. Democratic officials announced on Thursday that Sunday\\'s televised debate between Biden and Sanders would be moved to Washington from Arizona. Officials had already decided not to allow a live audience inside the debate hall, citing contagion concerns. Biden, Sanders and Trump have all canceled campaign events in recent days after warnings from public health officials about holding large-scale gatherings. Trump, who called off planned events in Nevada and Colorado this week, told reporters on Thursday he was also considering nixing plans for a March 25 rally in Tampa, Florida. \"I think we\\'ll probably not do it because people would say it\\'s better to not do,\" he said at the White House. Biden\\'s campaign on Wednesday converted planned rallies in Florida and Illinois into \"virtual\" campaign events as the coronavirus outbreak officially became a global pandemic. The Biden campaign created a committee composed mostly of doctors to advise on how to keep the candidate, staff and voters safe. Sanders\\' campaign has said it will address plans on a day-to-day basis. COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is a highly contagious respiratory illness. The number of U.S. coronavirus cases has risen steadily to 1,311, with 38 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Sanders, a democratic socialist, said on Wednesday he would stay in the race despite his primary losses to Biden. Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio hold nominating contests on Tuesday.

But in China, where the epidemic originated, officials said the disease had peaked and the global spread could be over by June if other nations applied similarly aggressive containment measures as Beijing\\'s communist government, which locked down a province with a population the size of Italy\\'s. Fears of the impact of such restrictions on the movement of people and goods hit global stocks and oil prices hard.

But its progress in the epicenter of China\\'s Hubei province has slowed markedly amid strict curbs on movement, including the lockdown of provincial capital Wuhan. Hubei logged just eight new infections on Wednesday, the first time in the outbreak it has recorded a daily tally in single figures. The rest of mainland China had seven new cases, six of them imported from abroad. \"The peak of the epidemic has passed for China,\" said Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission.

The   is now expected to end the year at 3,279, versus a prior forecast of 3,400, according to strategist Lori Calvasina. Full-year earnings per share will be $165, she predicted, from a prior $174. She is also shifting to neutral on growth-versus-value, from a prior bias toward value, upgrading health care to overweight from market-weight and downgrading financials to market-weight from overweight. This will be “a flat or lost year for the index,” Calvasina wrote in a note Thursday. “The brunt of the pain that the U.S. equity market will experience due to the coronavirus will occur early in the year, with the bulk of the economic impact coming mid-year, and a recovery trade taking hold once the news flow around the coronavirus improve and/or the valuation appeal of stocks becomes more clear.” Calvasina isn’t the only strategist reassessing in light of the coronavirus-induced market meltdown.   (SIX: ) Group AG’s Jonathan Golub lowered his year-end target to 3,300 from 3,600;   Inc (NYSE: ).’s David Kostin cut his to 3,200 and called for an end to the bull market.   (PA: ) SA’s Sophie Huynh now has hers at 3,500 -- but sees the lion’s share of the rally later in the year after the gauge languishes for some time due to the current uncertainty. Going forward, Calvasina said she’s watching for evidence of investor capitulation, a “necessary though not sufficient condition” for a bottom. In terms of key downside levels, if investors price in a recession, the S&P 500 could fall to around its December 2018 low of 2,351, she said. If the gauge’s price-to-earnings ratio drops to the December 2018 trough of 14.4, the index would be at 2,381, she said. “The median and average drop in the S&P 500 associated with recessions dating back to the 1930s has been 24% and 32%, which would take the S&P 500 down into the 2300-2600 range,” Calvasina wrote. However, she added that “we think it’s important to keep in mind that the recessionary drawdowns of the Financial Crisis and Tech bubble were more extreme than the historical norm, and we do not see the same kinds of excesses today.” Add a Comment'], ['By Yasin Ebrahim\\xa0 Investing.com – Selling resumed on Wall Street Thursday as the wave of buying following the Federal Reserve\\'s bold liquidity package ran out of steam amid fears that extra stimulus will do little stem the coronavirus-led blow to global supply chains.

Fears of a U.S. recession rose in step with an increase in the number of people infected by the virus, which causes the sometimes fatal COVID-19 respiratory illness. The concerns were reflected in U.S. stock markets, with major indexes entering bear-market territory.  California and New York announced sweeping bans on large gatherings and more schools, museums and other institutions announced plans to close.  Officials in the hardest-hit parts of the country, including New York and Washington states, were trying to balance the need to protect the public from the highly contagious coronavirus while stopping short of actions that could freeze the daily lives of millions of people and stop economic activity. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency to fight the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, allowing him to use new powers as the number of confirmed cases rose to 95 cases in the nation\\'s most populous city. New York state will ban gatherings of more than 500 people beginning at 5 p.m. on Friday in order to slow the spread of the virus, Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference. Establishments that can fit 500 people or fewer must halve their capacity beginning on Friday, Cuomo said. Broadway theaters in Manhattan will have to start observing the new rules on Thursday night, Cuomo said. Hospitals, nursing homes, mass transit and certain other facilities will be exempt from the new rule.  New York\\'s Metropolitan Museum of Art, the largest art museum in the world, said it was temporarily closing all three of its locations in the city. In Washington, officials ordered the U.S. Capitol complex closed to much of the public starting on Thursday, a day after a staffer for a senator from Washington state tested positive for the coronavirus.  Hollywood has postponed the release of several movies and movie theaters around the world have been closed over the health crisis. More than 1,300 U.S. cases of coronavirus have been confirmed and 38 people have died. A nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, has accounted for a large share of the deaths. The state of Georgia reported its first death on Thursday. Florida Senator Rick Scott said he would quarantine himself after meeting last week with a member of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro\\'s delegation in Florida. Another Bolsonaro official on the trip has since tested positive for the virus. President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met the Brazilian delegation, but White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said: \"Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time.\"  U.S. health officials have struggled to quickly expand testing capacity to make screening for the virus widely available, and have acknowledged that it is not easy for those possibly exposed to the virus to get tested.  \"The system is not really geared to what we need right now,\" Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. official on infectious diseases, said at a congressional hearing. \"The idea of anybody getting it (testing) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we\\'re not set up for that.\" Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks and at least one player in the National Basketball Association are among those who have been infected with the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia and other respiratory problems, especially in the elderly and those with compromised immune systems.  The NBA has suspended its season until further notice. The National Hockey League announced on Thursday it was pausing its season and Major League Soccer announced a 30-day suspension of its season. Major League Baseball also reportedly suspended spring training and delayed the start of its regular season. The outbreak has forced the closure of many schools and prompted some universities, including Harvard and Princeton, to announce they will move to virtual classroom instruction after the spring break later this month. \\'SELF-QUARANTINE\\' U.S. citizens and permanent residents returning from Europe will be screened for the virus and asked to go into \"self-quarantine\" for 14 days as part of new travel restrictions that affect 26 nations but exempt Britain and Ireland, Pence said in an interview with CNN. \"Americans coming home will be funneled through 13 different airports, they\\'ll be screened, and then we\\'re going to ask every single American and legal resident returning to the United States to self-quarantine for 14 days,\" Pence said. Trump on Thursday defended his decision to impose the measures, which go into effect at midnight on Friday and last for 30 days. Speaking to reporters at the White House, he said the ban could be lengthened or shortened. The travel restrictions will heap more pressure on airlines already reeling from the pandemic, hitting European carriers the hardest, analysts said. American Airlines Inc (O: ) and Delta Air Lines Inc (N: ) said they were capping fares for U.S.-bound flights from Europe amid reports of exorbitant pricing as U.S. citizens flocked to European airports trying to return home. Delta said it would suspend eight U.S. flights to Europe on Friday and \"continues to evaluate additional schedule adjustments based on customer demand.\" Global stock markets sank again on Thursday. The   and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) fell about 10%. Airline and some cruise line stocks were particularly hard hit. The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on Democrats\\' sweeping coronavirus bill on Thursday, according to a Democratic aide.  Republicans have balked at the plan and called for a delay in considering the proposed legislation, and Trump said on Thursday he didn\\'t support the bill.  Instead, Trump has pushed for a payroll tax cut and instructed the Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain business and individuals hit by the health crisis. The Senate plans to return next week to work on its legislation rather than have a week-long recess.

( ) dropped 26%, marking its largest fall in seven years, as fears of the coronavirus\\' economic impact unnerved investors. Palladium and platinum - precious metals that are key components of auto exhaust systems - posted their biggest declines since the 1980s as they fell 20.4% and 11.1%, respectively. Canada\\'s main stock market plunged by the most on record and the oil-sensitive Canadian dollar weakened to a four-year low as   tumbled 7.2%, while Europe\\'s STOXX 600 index ( ) fell more than 11%. The sell-offs were spurred by factors ranging from uncertainty over the virus\\' trajectory and its economic impact, to worries over how a U.S. travel ban to Europe will hit airlines and demand for oil. Some selling also likely came from investors raising cash to meet financing requirements on leveraged equity positions that came under pressure as the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ), S&P 500 ( ) and Nasdaq Composite index ( ) all fell more than 9%. David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures in Chicago, said traders and investors sold every asset class. \"It is a rush to cash and a mild panic-type move,\" Meger said. \"People are selling gold and silver positions to finance equity positions or other situations.\" Demand for cash has grown in recent weeks, as markets became more turbulent. U.S. money market funds took in a record $87.6 billion in the week to Wednesday as stocks on Wall Street buckled, data from Lipper showed. The double-digit sell-off in palladium was bolstered by the successful development of a new tri-metal auto catalyst allowing for the partial substitution of the metal with cheaper platinum, a development announced earlier in the week, trader said. Oil-related securities also marked double-digit declines, with the S&P energy index ( ) falling 12.3%. MSCI\\'s widely followed all-country world index  posted its biggest single-day decline in 32 years, of 9.3%, as European shares tumbled. \"We\\'re probably going to continue to see more panic selling and as we near that capitulation, you\\'re going to see further downward pressure on risky assets,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA in New York, referring to the time when investors give up trying to recover lost gains. Add a Comment'], ['By Tom Westbrook and Scott Murdoch SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - As a collapse in the oil price unleashed chaos in financial markets, Madrid money manager Diego Parrilla phoned a colleague who agreed: they had better head to work early in the morning. By daybreak in Europe, the price of   had fallen by a third. The shock had turned worry about the coronavirus to full-blown panic, wiped trillions of dollars from Asian stocks and sent futures for European and U.S. markets plunging. \"We assessed the book,\" said Parrilla, 46, who runs a 300 million euro ($332 million) fund that is long gold and bonds and uses options to bet on just about everything but dollars and volatility falling. \"We were in a good position,\" he said. \"We decided which parts of the portfolio we would take profits on first.\" So began what became the worst week on Wall Street since 2008, which has left Parrilla one of the few winners in the shakeout that ended the longest bull run in U.S. history. His Quadriga Igneo fund is up 30% for the year to date. The wipeout has also exposed the complacency of investors as markets marched toward record peaks in February, and the inadequacy of their protection as traditional risk correlations broke down in the rout. And for others it holds both clues as to what happens next and great promise. \"It\\'s these times that great fortunes are built, not bull markets,\" said James Rosenberg, private client advisor at brokerage and wealth manager Baillieu Holst in Sydney. \"But you have to buy the right companies, you have to have an appetite for some pain and misery and you have to be patient.\" OIL SHOCK The twist that sent markets already stressed by the global coronavirus outbreak into a tailspin was a plunge in the already weak oil price that followed Saudi Arabia\\'s move to launch a price war with Russia last weekend. The 30% drop had oil-linked currencies cratering – the rouble  fell 9% - and the stock prices of household-name oil majors from Shell (AS: ) to ExxonMobil (N: ) were down by double digits. By day\\'s end, the bonds of heavily indebted energy firms were trading many times beneath their face value, and fears of a credit crunch were growing. It was at this point that Parrilla, who had argued for years that equities were overvalued and that the cost of betting against them in the options market was good value, was laying fresh bets. \"We came in on Monday, and we see things are happening. And from a disciplined point of view, we were actually putting more trades, on things that were lagging, such as the  ,\" he said, referring to the Chicago Board Options Exchange\\'s Volatility Index. Talk on trading floors and at funds from Sydney to Singapore, Hong Kong, London and New York, was of crisis. \"When these big things happen, then you have no floor,\" said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at German asset management firm DWS. \"You can\\'t really work out the fundamentals, it\\'s not priced in,\" he said. Taylor spent the evening on a phone hook-up with other regional chiefs to discuss the oil move, followed by another meeting the next evening to go over global economic forecasts. \"When it happens, you can\\'t do much about it,\" said Taylor, whose experience in the Mexican, Russian and Asian financial crises in the 1990s and the global financial crisis in 2008, taught him hard lessons about liquidity and helped him prepare. \"People laugh at the old-fashioned techniques of the older guys, but when it happens we come out slightly better, because you\\'re not caught with midcaps and liquidity. It\\'s liquidity that really gets you in these markets,\" he said. WRONG-WAY WEDNESDAY Which is more or less what played out through the rest of the week, after what proved to be a dead-cat bounce on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump\\'s announcement on Wednesday of surprise restrictions on travel from 26 European nations, his failure to mention medical measures that would be taken to combat coronavirus and disappointment over the European Central Bank\\'s decision not to cut interest rates didn\\'t just put stock indexes into freefall. Rather than fleeing into safe havens, investors sold them to cover other losses. Bond yields, which had dived only days earlier, rose. At the same time volatility in the currency market shot higher with the squeeze in liquidity. \"The amounts are smaller, but the spreads are much wider because liquidity is starting to disappear from the system,\" said Stuart Oakley, Nomura\\'s global head of flow FX in Singapore. \"The markets have become so disorderly the correlations between assets and currencies have completely broken down. We\\'re in an entirely different world. It\\'s unnerving bigtime, because it tells you people are being forced to unwind positions.\" BLACK THURSDAY By Thursday it had become a mad scramble for dollars and nothing else, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) suffering its worst day since 1987. After a big rebound on Friday, the index was down 10.4% for the week while the S&P 500 index ( ) had shed 8.9%. When Australian fund manager Geoff Wilson woke at 2 a.m., as is his custom, the tone of voice alone on CNBC was enough to know the crash he had begun to prepare for was on. \"This has happened so quickly,\" said Wilson, whose firm Wilson Asset Management runs roughly A$3 billion ($1.84 billion) and has more than doubled its cash exposure over the past three weeks. \"To me this is a combination of \\'87 and the global financial crisis,\" he said, having spent the week between work and home revisiting every investment thesis to weed out weak stocks. \"We\\'d bought them because when interest rates are low and the economy\\'s going reasonably well, then debt wasn\\'t a major concern ... now that\\'s out the door.\" By the end of the week Europe\\'s benchmark STOXX 600 index ( ) had fallen 18%. Australia\\'s ASX 200 index ( ) was down 11% and the S&P 500 was headed for its worst week since 2008. Like Parrilla in Madrid, who has another leg of bets on a further downturn in China, Wilson expects things to get worse before they get better. Others, though, are finding some of the discounts irresistible. Scott Flanders, former chief executive officer of Playboy Enterprises and the head of online insurance marketplace eHealth, called his brokers in New York at breakfast time in Palo Alto, California, on Monday. \"I\\'m putting money to work right now,\" he said. \"I bought 5,000 shares in JPMorgan (NYSE: ), I bought Bank of America (NYSE: ) and   (NYSE: ). They\\'re getting hit hard ... but they\\'re so much better capitalized than they were during the \\'08 crisis.\" (Graphic: Volatility is back on Wall Street - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3235/3196/Pasted%20Image.jpg) Add a Comment'], ['(Reuters) - Some short-seller favorites this week as the U.S. stock market nosedived on coronavirus fears looked counter-intuitive because the companies might benefit from the crisis, notably 3M Co (N: ),   (O: ) and Alphabet Inc (O: ), according to S3 Partners. Short sellers sell borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back at a cheaper price and pocketing the difference. Short sellers built their largest dollar bets in biopharmaceutical company Abbvie (N: ) this week to Thursday, according to S3, but even more notable was the popularity of 3M, which makes everything from Post-it notes to protective masks. Although mask demand surged as people looked frantically for protection against infection from the coronavirus, 3M saw the eighth biggest increase in the dollar amount of its shares sold short this week, with an additional $245.75 million more of its shares borrowed to sell, the firm\\'s data showed. Facebook was also in high demand with shorts with an additional $244.9 million of its shares sold short in the same timeframe, making it the ninth most popular among shorts. The two classes of shares in Google parent Alphabet were also in demand, making them the 11th and 18th most popular stocks to borrow. In Alphabet\\'s C shares, $234.3 million worth were sold short, while $184.1 million of its A shares were borrowed to sell. \"Those are things I wouldn\\'t have thought would be on this list because their products and services are high demand,\" said S3 managing director Ihor Dusaniwsky, noting that as more people stayed home with a view to protecting against the virus\\' spread, it would seem likely that they would use online services such as Facebook and Google more than ever. By Friday\\'s close 3M shares were 10.9% below where they were before the broader market sell-off began on Feb. 20. In comparison the S&P 500 ( ) benchmark index on Friday was 19.9% below its Feb. 19 record. Facebook fell 21.7% in the same timeframe, and Alphabet\\'s A shares have fallen more than 20%. Abbvie saw an increase in short selling to the tune of $402.7 million worth of shares, according to S3. At No. 2 was MGM Resorts (N: ) with $342.4 million worth of new short-selling, followed by   Corp (N: ). The stocks with the biggest decline in the value of short positions in the last week were Digital Realty (N: ), AT&T Inc (N: ) and   Corp (N: ).

Following an 11-year bull market, many investors have never experienced a market selloff as violent as the near 27% slump in the S&P 500 ( ) from its record highs through Thursday, brought on by fears about the coronavirus pandemic, or Friday\\'s 9% rebound. Thursday\\'s 10% drop on the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) was its steepest one-day decline since Oct. 19, 1987, now known as \"Black Monday,\" when the Dow crashed a record 22.6%. Clayton Phillips, a 25 year-old financial adviser at Keenan Financial in Boston, said the recent selloffs marked the first major declines he has seen during his two-and-half years in the industry. The best precedents, he said, were financial histories he studied in preparation for a certification exam. \"I\\'ve been reading about this,\" he said. \"But it\\'s different to see it in real time.\" Villere & Co partner George Young began working as a stock broker in 1984 and remembers offers to buy and sell shares of smaller companies all but drying up on Black Monday. Young said his biggest takeaway from that day is, \"If you can stand the volatility, you will be rewarded over time. But you have to take a sanguine and long-term attitude.\" Since the S&P 500 began its tumble from its Feb. 19 record high over fears about the coronavirus and its potential damage to the global economy, markets have been besieged by volatility. The S&P 500 has seen 12 days in 2020 with swings of 1% or more, compared to 15 such days in all of 2019. Friday\\'s comeback, after U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to combat the outbreak, was the biggest one-day percentage gain for the S&P 500 since Oct. 28, 2008. Many Millennials in recent years embraced stocks, anxious to partake in a bull market that started in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and stretched through February. Too young to remember the market traumas of 2008, many use the Robinhood smartphone app offering no-fee trades that can make it attractive for investors with small amounts of money. Phillip Perry, a 37-year-old financial planner and colleague of Phillips\\' at Keenan Financial, estimated he has spoken with more than 30 clients this week under 30 years old, all of whom were shocked by the market chaos. \"Everybody\\'s freaking out,\" he said. \"They\\'ve literally never seen volatility. The VIX has been has been at historic lows, they pick their Robinhood stocks and feel like really savvy investors because it keeps going up. So their initial question now is, do they get out now, do they stop the bleeding?\" Wall Street\\'s fear gauge, the VIX ( ) jumped to its highest since the 2008 financial crisis on Friday after logging its biggest-ever one-day surge in history the day before. Perry said he advises his clients to stay the course, speaking as one of the firms\\' more experienced hands. His views echo those of Donald Selkin, whose first job in the financial industry was trading commodities at Merrill Lynch in 1978. Now chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities in New York, Selkin said his most vivid Black Monday memories are of traders paying extremely high prices for derivatives to hedge against even more volatility in the sessions that followed. That ended up being a bad bet because the market soon stabilized, with Black Monday in retrospect appearing to be one of modern history\\'s best buying opportunities. \"My advice to younger people would be to stick your toe in at these lower prices, selectively, and dollar cost average on the down days,\" Selkin said. Shawn Cruz, TD Ameritrade\\'s 36-year-old manager of trader strategy, in recent days has drawn on lessons he learned at business school about the causes behind the 2008 crisis, and said he has been applying those lessons to predict the coronavirus\\' likely impact on the economy. The suspension of professional sports games, canceled conventions and half-empty restaurants has raised fears - not about whether the longest U.S. economic expansion on record is ending - but about how deep a now presumed recession will be. \"It\\'s like when you\\'re in the military and you go through all this training, but it\\'s not like when there are real bullets flying,\" Cruz said.

The coordinated global actions were reminiscent of the sweeping steps taken just over a decade ago to fight a meltdown of the global financial system, but this time the target was an entirely unfamiliar foe - a fast-spreading health crisis with no certain end in sight that is forcing entire societies to effectively shut down. In a news conference Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the epidemic was having a \"profound\" impact on the economy, forcing whole industries like travel and leisure offline. Yet the ultimate spread of the virus is so uncertain, Powell said, the Fed called off quarterly economic forecasts due this week as a futile exercise until it is clear how many people will get sick, and how long public gatherings will need to be discouraged in the name of public health. \"The economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis and it is depending on the spread of the virus ... That is not something that is knowable,\" Powell said at the end of an emergency Fed meeting held in place of the Fed\\'s regular meeting this week. Given the depth and uncertainty of the risks, Powell said the Fed and other central banks were acting to ensure that financial markets keep functioning around the world, and trying to limit the chance that companies, households or financial institutions are dragged down by any slump in business.  To that end the Fed included dramatic moves to keep credit flowing to businesses and families, encouraging banks to tap trillions of dollars in equity and liquid assets built up as capital buffers since the financial crisis to support people whose lives may be upended by the virus.  \"The virus is having a profound effect on people across the United States and around the world,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a news conference after cutting short-term rates to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and announcing at least $700 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities purchases in coming weeks.  \"We really are going to use our tools to do what we need to do here,\" Powell said, adding that the Fed has gone in \"strong\" and could increase bond-buying and use other tools to support market functioning and the flow of credit, what he called the Fed\\'s \"most important\" function.  A broader set of Fed powers, including direct lending to financial firms, remains at the Fed\\'s disposal, and Powell said the central bank would not hesitate to use them if needed. \"He sounded like (former ECB President Mario) Draghi saying he will do what it takes, and we believe him,\" Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, wrote in an email to clients. Draghi, who stepped down as head of the ECB last year, famously pledged in 2012 to \"do whatever it takes\" to combat a crisis then threatening to tear the monetary union apart, a bold declaration that is broadly credited with saving the euro. As governments restrict gatherings, businesses and schools close, and families begin to hunker down in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus, Fed officials will \"do what we can to ease hardship\" as economic activity slows this quarter and next, he said.  Powell said he could not say how long or how big the downturn will be, but promised to keep rates where they are until Fed officials are \"confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals.\" The Fed will delay official economic forecasts until June, he said. The Fed and other major foreign central banks also cut pricing on their swap lines to make it easier to provide dollars to financial institutions around the world facing stress in credit markets.  The action amounted to an implicit acknowledgement that the outbreak was bringing economic activity in the United States and abroad to a \"sudden stop,\" said Sebastian Galy, senior strategist for Nordea in Luxembourg.  And Julia Coronado, president of MacroPolicy Perspectives and a former Fed economist, said she thought still more help may be on the way. “I think this is the start and not the full scope of what we’re going to see,” she said, adding that the Fed may coordinate with Treasury to launch other emergency lending tools, including one aimed to add liquidity to short-term corporate credit markets.

It lowered the primary credit rate by 150 basis points to 0.25 percent in order to encourage banks to tap its emergency lending window. Depository institutions may borrow from this so-called discount window for periods as long as 90 days, pre-payable and renewable by the borrower on a daily basis, it said. The Fed also said it would support U.S. banks that began to tap the capital and liquidity buffers they built up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and would reduce reserve requirement ratios to 0% effective on March 26.  \"This action eliminates reserve requirements for thousands of depository institutions and will help to support lending to households and businesses,\" the Fed said. President Donald Trump called the actions \"good news\" that \"makes me very happy.\" It was the third time this month the U.S. central bank took emergency action to protect financial markets and the economy.  On March 3, it cut interest rates by a half of a percentage point and last week in the face of an accelerating market meltdown it injected cash into short-term funding markets and launched a wave of Treasury security purchases.

Treasury yields stand near record lows, reflecting investors\\' thirst for U.S. government bonds in the wake of a stock decline that has seen the S&P 500 give up more than 20% from its record high on concerns that the coronavirus will hit economic growth. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc have both touched multi-year highs against the dollar in recent days, while gold prices hit a seven-year peak earlier this month.  (Graphic: Safe havens on the run link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/3418/3379/Pasted%20Image.jpg) That avalanche of buying has skewed the normal trading patterns of many haven assets, leaving investors vulnerable to unexpected price swings and periods of illiquidity, adding an extra dimension of risk to a market already fraught with pitfalls.  Gold  Prices for the metal fell another 3.3% and Treasury yields shot higher on Friday, amid a sharp selloff in haven assets and a rebound in stocks after U.S. President Donald Trump opened the door to providing what he said would be about $50 billion in federal aid to fight the disease.  Meanwhile, liquidity in the $17 trillion Treasuries market has deteriorated to its worst levels since the financial crisis, traders said. Some market participants have in recent days complained of being unable to get a satisfactory market price, a result of too many buyers and not enough sellers.  \"The U.S. Treasury bond market is supposedly the most liquid of the financial markets (except the FX market). Yet yesterday there were reports that there was diminishing liquidity in important sectors of the market. That\\'s unprecedented,\" analysts at BDSwiss said in a note to clients on Friday. The volatility has also extended to the Japanese yen, which earlier this week notched three straight days in which it moved more than 1% against the dollar in either direction, the longest such streak in about seven years. At the same time, a sustained rise in the Japanese currency could leave it near levels that could prompt the Bank of Japan to curb its strength, some analysts believe. A strong currency tends to make a country\\'s exports less competitive abroad, an outcome Japan\\'s struggling economy can ill afford. Some investors have responded by bulking up on cash, which many regard as one of the safest havens of all. U.S. money market funds took in a record $87.6 billion in the week to Wednesday, data from Lipper showed. \"Sometimes you don\\'t need to get fancy with your allocations and when looking for a safe haven, cash is king,\" said Andrew Thrasher, a portfolio manager for Financial Enhancement Group in Indianapolis. \"It\\'s the one asset we can count on to retain its lack of correlation to equities, bonds, commodities, or whatever is being negatively impacted.\" Damien Bisserier, partner at Advanced Research Investment Solutions, believes the wild fluctuations in Treasuries and other haven assets will eventually subside.  \"I believe, at least on Treasuries and gold, they are still worth owning,\" he said. \"Those are significant components of our asset allocation strategy and will continue to be.\" Others have had success with options strategies that guard portfolios against outbreaks of volatility, although such trades have become increasingly expensive in recent days. Mike Tiedemann, chief executive of Tiedemann Advisors, in recent months purchased options that would rise in value if volatility surged in March - a trade that proved prescient. But similar options betting on market volatility later in the year have shot up in value after the market\\'s recent drop, he said. \"You\\'re better off just selling equities than trying to hedge now,\" he said. \"At this point, it\\'s hard to find value anywhere.\"      Add a Comment'], ['By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Less than 48 hours after U.S. President Donald Trump bragged about his soothing influence on the stock market, Wall Street tanked again.

That heightened alarm about the rapid spread of the pandemic and how it has paralyzed parts of the global economy and squeezed company revenue. Investors appear increasingly worried about how effectively policymakers will be able to mitigate the economic damage from the spreading virus.

But President Donald Trump refrained from ordering sweeping public quarantines or lockdowns for the time being, even as some state and local authorities imposed mandatory restrictions of their own on eateries, movie theaters and other places of leisure in a bid to contain the respiratory virus. \"We\\'re recommending things,\" Trump told a White House news conference. \"We haven\\'t gone to that step yet\" of ordering a lockdown. \"That could happen, but we haven\\'t gone there yet.\" Trump also said a nationwide curfew was not under consideration at this point, and that postponements of primary elections, like those announced in Georgia and Louisiana, were generally unnecessary. The number of known coronavirus infections and deaths in the United States paled in comparison with hot spots of the global pandemic, such as China, Italy or Iran. But the tally of confirmed U.S. cases has multiplied quickly over the past few weeks, surpassing 4,300 to date and prompting fears American hospitals might soon be overwhelmed, as Italian medical centers have been strained to the breaking point. At least 80 people in the United States had died of the virus, as of Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University and public health agencies, with the hardest-hit state, Washington, accounting for the bulk of those fatalities, including six more announced on Monday. Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said health officials were relying on members of the millennial generation - those in their 20s to 40s, and representing the largest living adult cohort - to alter their social behavior for the good of the public. \"Why do I think the millennials are the key? Because they\\'re the ones that are out and about, and they\\'re the most likely to be in social gatherings, and they\\'re the most likely to be the least symptomatic,\" Birx told the briefing. COORDINATED NATIONAL RESPONSE  Release of the latest 15-day plan for slowing the spread of the virus came as state and local government officials pleaded with the Trump administration to mount a coordinated national response to the pandemic, as millions of workers and students were already hunkering down at home. Besides recommendations to avoid social gatherings and close bars, restaurants and other public places in states where community spread of the virus is evident, Birx said one of the most important measures was for people who are sick to stay home. \"If everybody in America does what we ask for over the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference,\" Birx said. The unprecedented wave of closures and restrictions, which began to accelerate last week, took on fresh urgency as New Jersey \"strongly discouraged\" all non-essential and non-emergency travel between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m., starting on Monday. The states of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut struck a regional agreement to close all movie theaters, casinos and gyms as of 8 p.m. EDT Monday (0000 GMT). Restaurants and bars in the three states - where more than 22 million people live - will serve takeout and delivery only. Officials in six San Francisco Bay Area counties on Monday ordered residents to stay at home for all but the most crucial outings until April 7. In the nation\\'s capital, Washington, a deeply divided Senate was considering a multibillion-dollar emergency spending bill requiring sick leave for some workers and expanded unemployment compensation, while the Supreme Court postponed oral arguments for the first time in over a century. Washington\\'s mayor on Monday also announced restrictions on businesses, including tough curbs on bars and restaurants, in response to the outbreak. From sidewalk shouting matches to politically fueled online sniping, tempers showed signs of fraying in some U.S. cities over the coronavirus pandemic. SCHOOLS CLOSED IN 33 STATES Some 64,000 U.S. schools were closed in at least 33 states, including in the nation\\'s two biggest public school systems - New York City and Los Angeles. School closures nationwide were disrupting instruction for at least 32.5 million students, according to Education Week. School districts are trying to find a way to provide meals and create lessons plans for the millions of students forced to stay home. [nL1N2B95B3] State restrictions on restaurants and places of leisure, while in line with expert advice to slow spread of the virus through \"social distancing,\" will hit many lower-paid workers in the service industry. Jessica Wilmot, owner of the Ancient Mariner pub in Ridgefield, Connecticut, said that while she felts closing shops was the right move, she worried about her mostly part-time staff who work paycheck to paycheck.  \"Personally I\\'m all for containment,\" said Wilmot, noting that her revenues had already fallen about 40% last week from the prior week. \"But my business view is, I\\'m nauseous.\" AIRLINES SEEK BAILOUT  As traders on Wall Street reacted to drastic weekend measures from the Federal Reserve to stave off a global recession, U.S. stock markets plunged anew on Monday with the   closing down 12%.  Major airlines sought a U.S. government bailout of more than $50 billion as the White House drafted a financial assistance package following the steep falloff in U.S. travel demand. \"We have to back the airlines,\" Trump said on Monday. \"It\\'s not their fault.\" Separately, U.S. airports are seeking $10 billion in government assistance. Trump, a Republican, declared a national emergency on Friday and has championed the U.S. government\\'s response, saying his administration has done a \"a very fantastic job.\" Democratic leaders have criticized him for downplaying the crisis and issuing misleading or false statements.  The outbreak also has taken a major toll on U.S. sports. Major League Baseball said it would further delay the start of its 2020 season, originally scheduled for next week, after the call by U.S. public health officials to cancel large public gatherings. The United States has lagged behind other industrialized nations in its ability to test for the novel coronavirus. In early March, the Trump administration said close to 1 million tests would soon be available and anyone who needed a test would get one, a promise it has failed to keep. Dr. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, said at the White House on Monday that 1 million tests were now available with help from leading commercial laboratories, and that at least 2 million test kits would be ready by next week.

The S&P 500 index ( ) has lost nearly $6 trillion since its record closing high in mid-February. The turmoil prompted the U.S. Federal Reserve on Sunday to take aggressive action to buttress the economy and financial system, slashing interest rates to near zero, pledging hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases and backstopping foreign authorities with the offer of cheap dollar financing. Some analysts speculated on Monday that closing the markets altogether might be the next step for regulators, which are rapidly running out of tools to arrest the turmoil. \"One might not be faulted to assume that a next major step might be to shut the stock markets to prevent a further, self-fueling sell-off,\" William O\\'Donnell, an analyst at   Global Markets Inc (N: ), wrote in a note on Monday. Closing the markets is rare but not unprecedented. The New York Stock Exchange, which is now owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, (N: ) most recently closed on Oct. 29-30, 2012 during Hurricane Sandy and before that on Sept. 11-14, 2011, following the terrorist attacks on the United States, according to its website. It also shut for four months during the outbreak of World War I, the longest closure on record. \"This is a World War against the virus, so maybe it’s not such a crazy idea?\" O\\'Donnell wrote. The NYSE trading floor remained open on Monday, but the iconic bourse was taking additional precautions, requiring people entering the building to disclose if they had been exposed to the virus and to submit to a temperature check, according to a Reuters reporter present. Those entering the floor were given stamps on their forearm to indicate they\\'d been checked. Speaking to Fox News on Monday, NYSE President Stacey Cunningham said closing the markets would be the \"wrong response,\" adding: \"It’s important that investors have access to their money.\" Nasdaq Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman also told CNBC on Monday it was \"critically important\" that markets remained open. The European Union\\'s markets watchdog said on Monday it was lowering the threshold for reporting short-selling, whereby traders profit by betting stocks will fall, to regulators for the next three months as current trading conditions posed a \"serious threat\" to \"fragile\" markets. (https://reut.rs/2wdJsP7) Clayton said the U.S. markets overall had continued to function well, re-opening in an orderly manner following the triggering of circuit-breakers last week. \"Things have been functioning well in our markets over the past two weeks of a very volatile time,\" he added.

At a news conference, Mnuchin said the Trump administration intends to keep markets open but said shortened trading hours may be needed at some point. He did not explain the conditions that could prompt the move. In response, CME Group (O: ) Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Duffy issued a statement objecting to any move to shorten the trading session due to high volatility. CME Group operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world\\'s largest derivatives bourse. Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N: ), which operates the New York Stock Exchange, said in a statement that its platforms were operating normally and that it was prepared to switch to all-electronic trading if necessary. \"Shorter hours make no sense,\" CME\\'s Duffy wrote. \"Markets are global, so shortening U.S. hours would not decrease volatility. Rather, it could actually increase as investors turn to other venues outside the U.S. when developments occur.\"  Portfolio managers and traders cited potential problems in cutting trading hours, such as increasing the burden on electronic trading infrastructure and hurting the market\\'s credibility, especially if it is perceived as a move to avoid further losses. \"Investors should feel as if the financial system is conducting business as usual,\" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, in Florham Park, New Jersey. With state and local governments across the United States taking steps to contain the coronavirus spread, including closing schools, restaurants and other meeting places, questions have swirled about whether stock markets will shutter. The S&P 500 ( ) jumped 6% on Tuesday, rebounding from Monday\\'s nearly 12% drop, which was the worst one-day decline since 1987. With the S&P 500 down 25% from its record high on Feb. 19, many investors have been unwilling to predict how much further Wall Street may fall. On Friday, the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N: ), issued a trader alert that it aims to keep its equity and options trading floors open \"in the days and weeks ahead.\"  \"We absolutely believe in keeping the markets open,\" Mnuchin told reporters. \"We may get to a point where we shorten the hours, if that\\'s something they need to do, but Americans should know that we are going to do everything that they have access to their money at their banks, to the money in their 401(k)s, and to the money in stocks,\" he added. The last time the NYSE closed due to an unforeseen circumstance was in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy battered New York City. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, the NYSE did not reopen until Sept. 17, when the S&P 500 tumbled nearly 5%. \"It\\'s more likely that we would have shorter trading hours than shutting down the market, but I don\\'t believe that will do much of anything,\" said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas, said a limited overnight trading window for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\\'s  , known as E-minis, might help reduce volatility. Late-night trading in E-minis, which is open nearly around the clock, is often thin and volatile and can have a big influence on investors looking for a reference point ahead of Wall Street\\'s opening bell, he said. \"My vote would be not to reduce trading hours, but if they are going to, overnight E-mini trading is the first place I would look,\" Dick said.

Gilead Sciences (O: ) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O: ) are each up 9% during that time, as both biotechnology firms race to develop coronavirus treatments.

In a sign of what may follow across the United States, New York and California imposed tough new measures, limiting the activity of 60 million people in the two states to curb the spread of coronavirus and ordering all non-essential workers to stay at home.

Stocks sold off on Monday even as the Fed pledged to expand purchases of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities and implement measures to backstop credit for households, small businesses and major employers -- part of a series of wide-ranging measures the central bank has rolled out in recent days to stabilize the markets and the economy. The moves have helped ease a liquidity squeeze in funding markets and signaled that the Fed was willing to take extraordinary steps in order to boost the economy. But investors said the Fed\\'s measures alone are unlikely to stem the stock market\\'s decline. The S&P 500 has plunged more than 30% in 22 trading days -- the fastest such drop in its history, according to BofA Global Research. \"These efforts alone are not going to do anything against the virus – that’s the big problem,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. \"We are going to take a pretty big economic hit here and economists have been revising their growth outlooks down and down and down every day.\" An initial lift to stock futures following the Fed announcement faded quickly. The S&P 500 ( ) was down more than 2% in afternoon trade, putting the benchmark U.S. index down more than 33% from its Feb. 19 record closing high. Investors are looking for signs of whether efforts to keep Americans and Europeans isolated will slow the rates of new infections and deaths tied to the coronavirus. Many have been disconcerted by lawmakers\\' inability to enact an economic stimulus package that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said carried a $2 trillion price tag. The stimulus package failed to advance in the U.S. Senate on Monday as Democrats said it contained too little money for hospitals and not enough restrictions on a fund to help big businesses.  Daniel Wiener, an investment adviser who runs a newsletter for Vanguard investors, said the Fed seemed to be stepping in with necessary moves at a time of political paralysis. “The Fed is jumping in here because the House, Senate and White House haven’t been able to figure out what to do,\" Wiener said. Initial estimates of the pandemic\\'s economic fallout have grown bleaker in recent days. U.S. unemployment could hit 30% and second-quarter economic output could be half the norm, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard told Reuters in an interview.   (NYSE: ) equity strategist Michael Wilson said in a note on Monday that his base case was for a 13% decline in earnings for S&P 500 companies this year. Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim, noted that the market fell 57% during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and 49% in the 2001-2002 recession. That could mean stocks still have plenty of room to fall, as the damage to the economy from the coronavirus outbreak may be greater than what it suffered in those two prior downturns, Minerd said in a note to investors last week.  \"We don’t even have to get to financial crisis levels for stocks to fall another 10 to 20 percent, but there’s good reason to believe that this is potentially worse than the financial crisis,\" he said.

U.S. markets have been roiled by the spread of the virus in the country and as states have shut parts of their economies.  Trump said on Monday that at the end of a 15-day shutdown period, which would run to the end of the month, \"we will make a decision as to which way we want to go.\"  Last week, Trump urged Americans to halt most social activities for 15 days. It is unclear what power Trump actually has to simply turn the economy back on by executive order.

It is down more than 30% from its Feb. 19 peak and is at levels not seen since the end of 2016, giving up nearly all of its gains from before Trump was elected.  BLEAK ESTIMATES Initial estimates of the pandemic’s economic fallout have grown bleaker in recent days.  U.S. unemployment could hit 30% and second-quarter economic output could be half the norm, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said.  Jennifer Pline, head of wealth management for Cambridge Trust in Boston, said it is too soon to judge whether to reopen the economy just yet.  \"As we’re just starting to close things down fairly tightly, we need to wait a while until we get more traction and less contagion with the virus.\" The cost of a mistake could be deadly. A March 16 study by Imperial College in London predicts 2.2 million deaths in the United States in an unmitigated epidemic, with critical care bed capacity exceeded as early as the second week in April. Economists at Northwestern University and Berlin’s Freie University estimated an “optimal containment policy” in the United States would deepen the subsequent recession but save 600,000 lives. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Ellis Phifer, market strategist for Raymond James in Memphis, Tenn. said he has struggled with the question of whether it would be best to reopen parts of the economy. “It’s really hard to determine which costs more,” Phifer said of the dueling approaches of lifting restrictions sooner or later. On balance, he would be inclined to follow the advice of public health experts like Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who have largely advocated for more restrictions.  TESTING KEY \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In an interview last week, Richmond Federal Reserve president Thomas Barkin said any call to try to resume normal economic activity will depend on widespread testing quick enough that businesses can establish protocols to ensure worker and customer safety.

Foreign portfolio outflows from mainland markets are set to hit a monthly record, with investors rushing for the safety of U.S. dollars as global equities markets tumble. As of Tuesday, the S&P500 index ( ) and the MSCI world price index ( ) have both slumped nearly 30% since Feb. 20, when coronavirus fears first gripped markets. By comparison, China's benchmark Shanghai index ( ) fell about 15% between mid-January and its trough in mid-March. (GRAPHIC: China stocks firmer relatively outperform as virus rocked world markets in the past month - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/16/12/12/China%20stocks%20firmer%20relatively%20outperform%20as%20virus%20rocked%20world%20markets%20in%20the%20past%20month.png) A key reason for the relative resilience of the A-share market is Beijing's effectiveness in controlling the virus outbreak and a peaking of infections on the mainland, analysts said.  Another is the hope for more fiscal and monetary policy measures to shore up demand as Beijing strives for a speedy recovery from a likely deep economic contraction in the first quarter.  Chinese policymakers have already implemented a raft of measures to support the economy. (GRAPHIC: China Feb producers prices fell back into deflation - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/15/9781/9781/China%20Feb%20producers%20prices%20fell%20back%20into%20deflation.png) The measures are expected to include more spending by local governments on infrastructure, a sector that was used by Beijing to bolster growth during the 2008 global financial crisis.  It is essential that the authorities prop up the traditional infrastructure sector to shore up the economy, said Niu Chunbao, chief investment officer at Wan Ji Asset, a Shanghai-based private equity fund.

A-shares are relatively cheaper while their Wall Street peers were at record highs before the slump, said Fu Yanping, analyst with China Galaxy Securities. (GRAPHIC: China stocks relatively less hit due partly to lower valuations - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzzifr/16/13/13/China%20stocks%20relatively%20less%20hit%20due%20partly%20to%20lower%20valuations.png) Foreign investors have, however, been heavy sellers in the A-share market in recent weeks, as tumbling global markets and a dash for dollars forced massive liquidation of stocks, bonds and emerging market currencies.  As of Friday, net selling by foreign investors via the Stock Connect scheme totaled about 70 billion yuan ($9.91 billion). That makes it likely March will see the biggest monthly selling since the launch of the scheme, which allows overseas investors convenient access to China's equities market.  Consumer stocks, one of foreign investors' heaviest exposure in the A-share market, suffered steep losses in the past month.  The outflows were exacerbated by a weaker yuan, which posted its worst week in seven months last week as the dollar surged. Separately, Chinese funds that facilitate domestic investment in overseas stock and bond markets have been inundated by investors eager to buy on the cheap.

The massive bill includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount for direct payments of up to $3,000 apiece to millions of U.S. families. Several Republican senators said the bill needed to be changed to ensure that laid-off workers would not be paid more than they earned on the job.  \"This bill pays you more not to work than if you were working,\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, told a news conference. In response, Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he was prepared to block the bill if Republicans do not drop their objections. That came after leaders of both parties predicted a Wednesday vote. \"Today the Senate will act to help the people of this country weather this storm,\" Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said after the chamber convened at noon (1600 GMT).  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his party was willing to pass the bill as quickly as possible. \"Help is on the way. Big help. Quick help,\" he said on the Senate floor.  Trump is ready to sign the measure into law, the White House said, but it was unclear how quickly Congress could get the package to his desk. McConnell did not say what time the Senate would hold its vote, and the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives is not expected to act before Thursday. The package will also include $350 billion for small-business loans, $250 billion for expanded unemployment aid and at least $100 billion for hospitals and related health systems. It would be the largest rescue package ever approved by Congress and the third such effort to be passed this month. The money at stake amounts to nearly half of the $4.7 trillion the U.S. government spends annually. \\'DROP IN THE BUCKET\\' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the $3.8 billion allocated to his state would not cover the tax revenue it stands to lose from reduced economic activity. His state accounts for roughly half of all U.S. coronavirus cases. \"That is a drop in the bucket,\" he said at a news conference.  The package aims to flood the U.S. economy with cash in a bid to stem the impact of a pandemic that has killed 812 people in the United States and infected more than 59,200.  The governors of at least 18 states, including New York, have issued stay-at-home directives affecting about half the U.S. population. The sweeping orders are aimed at slowing the pathogen\\'s spread, but have upended daily life as schools and businesses shutter indefinitely. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 ( ) rallied for a second straight day, closing up 1.15%. [nL1N2BI1YH] Republican Senator Rand Paul, the only senator to vote against an earlier round of emergency virus funding, may be unable to vote after testing positive for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. It also must pass the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who proposed a more far-reaching rescue package, did not say whether she would support the Senate version. \"We\\'ll see the bill and see how the Senate votes. So there\\'s no decision about timing until we see the bill,\" she told reporters.  Any changes made by the House would also require Senate approval, which could lead to further delays. The No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, told lawmakers that they would be notified 24 hours before any action.  House members left Washington 10 days ago, but the lower chamber could quickly pass the bill without requiring their return, through a \"voice vote\" that would require only a few lawmakers to be present. The top House Republican, Kevin McCarthy, said he would prefer that approach and called for its passage on Friday.

But the rebound doesn’t mean much without seeing sustained buying, market participants say. Asian stocks rose again on Friday, following the U.S. higher after the   climbed out of its bear market overnight. The   index has risen 13% from its March low after losing about a third of its value from a record high in January. Benchmark gauges in the Philippines, South Korea and India have all advanced more than 15% from recent lows, drawing closer to a 20% gain defined as a bull market. Japan’s   closed at 18% above its March low on Friday. “The 20% yardstick does not matter unless we start seeing higher highs and sustainable buying at lows,” said Jaiganesh Balasubramaniam, a market technician at Cashthechaos.com. “We need higher highs and higher lows on different time frames before we can say that we are out of bear markets.” Balasubramaniam added that the   Index has yet to mark a 20% gain from its recent trough so “investors should not go berserk about attaching bull market titles.” Meanwhile, some investors have been hunting for bargains after historic drops in the region’s equities. The Asian gauge is set for its fourth straight day of gains amid unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus across the globe in a bid to contain the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Volatility, however, remains high, with the 10-day realized measure on the Asian equity benchmark still around the highest since data going back to 2010. “It’s foolhardy to jump into a volatile market that has only risen for a few days after falling so heavily,” said Dale Gillham, chief analyst at Wealth Within. “It is very dangerous.” \\xa0 Add a Comment'], ['By April Joyner NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors hoping for calm to return to U.S. stocks will not find much comfort in Wall Street\\'s fear gauge known as the VIX, which shows some market participants are bracing for more turbulence despite this week\\'s bounce.  The Cboe Volatility Index ( ) is down nearly 20 points from its record closing high hit earlier this month but remains far above its usual levels. The index rose on Friday as U.S. stocks fell, even after the House of Representatives passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. It was last at 64.29. The persistent elevation of the index, which shot to its highest level since 2008 as markets plunged, sounded a discordant note during the rally earlier this week, which took the S&P 500 nearly 18% higher from Monday\\'s close to Thursday\\'s close. \"I do think the VIX is too high right now,\" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management. \"It\\'s pricing in 4% stock moves per day for the foreseeable future.\" The still-high VIX reflects both the aftershock of the massive price swings investors have endured as well as deep uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of the coronavirus and its economic fallout.  While unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve and the relief bill have bolstered hopes of averting worst-case economic scenarios, forecasts remain bleak. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), for instance, has projected a 24% year-over-year drop in U.S. gross domestic product in the second quarter as the outbreak halts business activity throughout much of the country.  \"In this respect, a VIX still hovering around 60 provides a much more sobering and fair assessment of the level of uncertainty present in markets and the global economy,\" analysts at Fathom Consulting wrote in a note to clients.  Past bouts of extreme volatility have often taken some time to subside. The VIX was just below 50 when stocks bottomed in March 2009 after a 57% drop from their October 2007 highs during the financial crisis. It may take months for the VIX to ease back to its usual levels, said Matt Amberson, principal at ORATS.  Realized volatility on the S&P 500 ( ) - a measure of actual moves on the index over the past 30 days - was at 97.4% on Friday, according to data from options analytics provider Trade Alert. By comparison, the VIX does not seem so high. \"Vol is very fair given the kind of moves that we\\'re having,\" said Henry Schwartz, founder of Trade Alert. Other measures, however, signal that some investors believe the selling may have already peaked.  For options on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P: ), implied volatility, bid-ask spreads and skew have all drifted lower after surpassing 2008 levels last week, Amberson said.  Implied volatility reflects investor expectations for market gyrations over the next month. The bid-ask spread is the gap between what sellers say they want to receive for securities and what buyers say they will pay. Skew measures the demand for puts, used to protect against downward moves, in comparison to calls, used to position for upside. A better indicator of volatility expectations may be VIX futures rather than the VIX itself, which is not traded, said Don Dale, chief risk strategist at Equity Risk Control Group. Front-month VIX futures ( ), which expire in mid-April and reflect expectations for volatility in the month following that date, have fallen even more significantly than the VIX in the past week-and-a-half. They were last trading at 51.1. \"Based on the term structure of the VIX, traders are expecting the market to be less turbulent as we move forward toward the summer,\" Dale said. \"But VIX traders are not pricing in an immediate reduction in turbulence. They\\'re expecting April to still be volatile.\"      Add a Comment'], ['By Kim Khan  - The U.S. House of Representatives passed the $2 trillion coronavirus fiscal stimulus package Friday, approving the bill with a voice vote.

The United States surpassed China as the nation with the most number of COVID-19 cases, putting more pressure on lawmakers to flood the country with cash to support businesses and families. \"We have still not fully understood the degree of the economic impact,\" said Massud Ghaussy, senior analyst at Nasdaq IR Intelligence in New York. \"Currently, from a policymaker\\'s perspective, it\\'s a relative balance between managing the spread of the virus and opening the economy.\" The U.S. House of Representatives is widely expected to clear a $2 trillion economic rescue package after the Senate passed the proposal on Thursday.

Pershing Square earned roughly $2.6 billion by hedging its stock portfolio in early March through credit protection on investment grade and high yield credit indices. Much of the money has been reinvested in stocks the firm already owns. \"Today, we are unhedged, and we no longer own any insurance\", Ackman said in a Twitter thread https:// adding that he continues to believe the sooner the entire United States is shut down, the more lives will be saved and the sooner the economy will recover. \"Every day we wait, we prolong our collective misery\", Ackman said.

The S&P 500 ( ) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) fell sharply after the interview aired. He later said the interview was not designed to enable his firm to profit from any trades, dismissing some media speculation that he had purposely pushed markets lower to make money off his hedges.

U.S. oil drillers, meanwhile, looked like they needed pacemakers as crude experienced another heart-stopping week of losses that left the market down nearly 65% on the year. The Covid-19 mega stimulus, meant to jolt the American economy back to life, did provide oxygen to Wall Street, lifting the  ,   and   to their first weekly gains in three.\\xa0 With stocks rising, gold also scored its best week in almost 12 years despite losing some of its lustre on Friday as investors cashed in on a portion of the yellow metal’s supercharged gains that came on the back of the approval for the $2 trillion package. Yet, none of that optimism made its way into oil. Crude was instead left to feel the real reason behind the stimulus: the terrifying predicament of the United States becoming No.1 for coronavirus infections, with record jobless claims, potential recession and long doom-and-gloom for oil demand to follow. Not only was oil missing any stimulus feeling - crude was also missing the $3 billion the Trump administration asked as funding for the 77 million barrels to top up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\\xa0 Despite the double-slap, some in the oil market kept their spirits up. \"There are two trillion reasons why oil will not go to zero, but we may not be out of the woods yet,\" Price Futures Group\\'s energy analyst Phil Flynn said, urging his audience to stay long. Despite crude\\'s relatively cheap price - Friday\\'s low in New York was $20.88 - there\\'s a gnawing feeling it might go even lower. And that\\'s possibly preventing any impulsive support building at the current lows as some actually expect\\xa0 prices in the teens at some point. And blame it all on the Saudis, the favorite target in the market now. Thursday’s G20 summit video-hosted by Saudi Arabia did not have oil and gas on its agenda, a sign that Riyadh and Moscow weren’t any closer to a detente in their crude production-and-price war.\\xa0 \"We commit to do whatever it takes and to use all available policy tools to minimize the economic and social damage from the pandemic, restore global growth, maintain market stability, and strengthen resilience,\" G20’s post-conference statement said. Missing was any mention of the elephant in the room: Energy. And this was Saudi Arabia - the world’s single most powerful country for oil - hosting. Dmitry Peskov, Russia’s spokesman to the summit, was non-committal as well when asked about crude. A day before the meeting, Pompeo had spoken to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. According to the State Department, Pompo told MBS, as the future Saudi king is known, that as chair of the G20 and important energy leader, Riyadh “has a real opportunity to rise to the occasion and reassure global energy and financial markets when the world faces serious economic uncertainty.”\\xa0 Uncoded, it meant: Get your act together with the Russians and start cutting some production, for all of our sakes. Yet, the rebuff by MBS couldn’t have been louder; a third slap, if you’ll like, for the oil market.\\xa0 It only proves the Saudis’ steely determination to grow their production by a whopping 30% in March to reach a record 12.3 million barrels per day by end-April.\\xa0 And if that wasn’t enough to convince the oil crowd to stay bearish, the International Energy Agency’s chief Fatih Birol gave then one more reason: That global oil demand could fall as much as 20 million barrels per day, or by 20%, as 3 billion people across the world remain on lockdown. , the New York-traded benchmark for U.S. crude prices, settled down $1.09, or 4.8%, on Friday at $21.51 per barrel.\\xa0 , the London-traded benchmark for crude, settled down $1.41, or 5.4%, at $24.93. For the week, WTI was down 4.1% while Brent slid 7.6%. For all of March so far, both benchmarks have lost more than 60% - heading for their worst month on record. Oil posted a fifth straight week of losses amid fear of more demand destruction as U.S. cities and businesses in the country braced for a greater shutdown after America eclipsed China as the nation with the largest number of coronavirus infections. As of Friday, Johns Hopkins University of Medicine’s real-time tracker for coronavirus infections reported more than 92,000 U.S. Covid-19 cases, overtaking China’s reported cases of under 82,000. By pre-dawn Sunday, the U.S. tally had jumped to almost 125,000, with nearly 2,200 deaths. Adding to the oil market’s woes, was IEA chief Birol’s warning that global demand for crude could fall by a whopping 20 million bpd. “This virus hit energy first, and now you have the IEA warning,” said Flynn, the energy analyst at Chicago’s Price Futures Group.\\xa0 “The massive drop in demand has even complicated the Saudi’s plan to flood the market as buyers of Saudi crude are reportedly looking to cancel oil delay shipments,” Flynn said, referring to the kingdom’s ill-timed production-and-price war with Russian and U.S. shale crude producers.\\xa0 Separately, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia was struggling to find customers for its extra oil as demand plummets due to the coronavirus and as freight rates surge. What started as a surprise Saudi gambit to offer its existing customers, as well as prospects, with virtually unlimited supply of crude at rock-bottom prices - so that it could poach markets from rival Russian and U.S. oil exporters - is having disastrous consequences for the kingdom.\\xa0 Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) and U.S. refiners were taking less Saudi crude; Finland’s Neste was not taking any in April; Indian refiners had sought delayed deliveries; and Polish refiners were easing up on purchases, the report said. Russia has also turned its spigots all the way up for a full-blown production-and-price-war with the Middle East oil power. “There is no doubt that the Russian and Saudi price war destroyed any shred of credibility they had as the global stabilizer of oil,” Flynn added. “Instead of acting to soften the economic blow from record demand destruction from the coronavirus, they let their egos allow the oil market to cause the world more economic pain. They used this crisis to gain more power and market share at the expense of the world community that is facing deaths and economic destruction from this virus. Instead of stabilizing the market, they created a situation where oil market volatility is at an all-time high.” Private Genscape data on Cushing oil inventory estimates  weekly report on oil stockpiles.

Nearly 70 of the top 600 listed companies in Europe cut or suspended dividends between Feb. 24 and March 31, a Reuters analysis found, while 18 of the top 100 London-listed companies have cut or delayed theirs.  By March 30, 12 S&P500 ( ) firms had reduced or suspended their dividends, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ).  The latest to rip up dividend plans include some of Europe\\'s top banks, such as HSBC (L: ) and Lloyds Banking Group (L: ), after pressure from regulators. Globally, the roll call of dividend-cutting companies straddles sectors, from aircraft maker Boeing (N: ) to automaker Ford Motor Company (N: ), and advertising giant WPP (L: ).  The pressure is also growing on other leading dividend payers, notably in the energy sector, whose earnings are being hit by deep oil price falls as coronavirus lockdowns destroy demand and supplies swell. [O/R] \"Companies can plan for a recession - it\\'s tough but provisions can be made. However, this environment is much more extreme with many businesses facing prolonged periods without revenue,\" said Ben Whitmore, who runs several funds at Jupiter Asset Management, including the Jupiter Income Trust. \"We have stress-tested the portfolio and made some sales of businesses where the balance sheet can\\'t cope with this stress.\" The wave of dividend cuts raises a question mark over mutual funds whose entire strategy is based on harvesting income streams to pay their clients and is an increasingly popular play with retail investors seeking a steady stream of returns. Between 2018 and 2019, European-based global income funds saw their assets rise by 21% to 90.2 billion euros ($99.25 billion), data from Morningstar showed. For now, income fund managers say all they can do is focus on companies that may still need to cut payouts to preserve cash in the short run, but are likely to weather the expected sharp downturn. \"For our portfolio, the key at the moment is the protection of capital and ensuring that the fund is best placed for when we come out of the tunnel. Being in a strong position for capital growth will mean the medium-term position for income will be strong,\" Chris Murphy, manager of the   (LON: ) Investors UK Equity Income Fund, said.  He said he had added to positions in insurer   (L: ) and money manager   (L: ).

By March 25, the value of assets in British dividend funds - which totalled around 43 billion pounds ($53.16 billion) at the start of the month - had fallen by an average 30.2%, against 25.3% for the   All Share according to data from Morningstar, although to-date, there have been no fund closures. European dividend futures show markets pricing in a 45% cut to dividends in 2020 with a further significant fall in 2021, Nicolas Simar, Senior Portfolio Manager Euro & European High Dividend, said. \"This seems overdone to us,\" Simar said. \"As a comparison, dividends fell around 30% in Europe during the great financial crisis (of 2007-8), and for an average recession, the figure is about 10%. \"While there is not much that is average about the current situation, it\\'s not obvious to us that the end point, from a dividend perspective, should be half again as bad as the 2008 crisis.\" Refinitiv data shows analysts expect STOXX Europe 600 dividend payouts to fall by around $10 billion over the next 12 months.

Matthew Jennings, Equity Income Investment Director at Fidelity International, said the unique circumstances surrounding this round of dividend cuts should offer some solace to investors, especially if a temporary conservation of cash ensures a stronger recovery.  With an estimated one-third of the world\\'s population in lockdown, and political pressure building in some countries for companies to show restraint, it was vital to work out which companies had suffered a long-term hit to value, he said. \"A dividend cut in normal circumstances can be a signal of a business that has been poorly managed or is in structural decline. However, this is not necessarily the case today,\" Jennings said, adding the firm backed the deferral of bank sector dividends. \"We have no automatic knee-jerk reaction to a dividend cut in the portfolio. In many cases a dividend cut today will be in the long-term interests of shareholders and aid a speedy recovery on the other side of the pandemic.\"      Add a Comment'], ['By Yasin Ebrahim\\xa0 Investing.com – The Dow plunged as a wave of late selling hit Wall Street Wednesday as investors pulled their bullish bets on stocks on rising fears the economic hit from the Covid-19 pandemic could be worse than feared, with infections in the U.S. topping 200,000.

U.S. stocks rallied after U.S. President Donald Trump said he expects Russia and Saudi Arabia to announce an oil production cut of up to 10 million to 15 million barrels as the two countries signaled willingness to make a deal.

Add a Comment\"], ['By Jonathan Stempel NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic may have erased around $64 billion of value from Warren Buffett\\'s equity portfolio at   (N: ), setting up the conglomerate for one of the largest quarterly losses ever by an American company. \"The headline number will be ugly,\" said James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst with a \"buy\" rating on Berkshire, referring to net results.  Berkshire\\'s portfolio of U.S.-listed stocks, including Kraft Heinz Co (O: ), may have shrunk by 26% in the first quarter if Berkshire did no buying and selling, according to Refinitiv data and regulatory filings.  By contrast, the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 ( ) fell just 20%, and Berkshire\\'s own stock fell about the same. Buffett urges investors to think long-term, focusing on Berkshire\\'s operating results and the intrinsic value of its stock holdings, some of which it has owned for decades. In his Feb. 22 shareholder letter, Buffett said he expects the stocks to deliver \"major gains,\" albeit irregularly. Still, the declines reflect challenges the pandemic poses even for Buffett, the world\\'s fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine and among its most esteemed investors. They also followed Buffett\\'s prediction in a Feb. 24 interview on CNBC, five days after the S&P 500 set an all-time high, that Berkshire would outperform in down markets, and over the long term perform \"in a very, very safe manner.\" The 89-year-old Buffett had prostate cancer in 2012, and last month began working at his Omaha, Nebraska, home rather than Berkshire\\'s office two miles away. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent to his assistant. Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance, its namesake energy company and smaller businesses such as See\\'s candies and Borsheims jewelry. AIRLINES STAGGER Since 2018, an accounting rule has required Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stocks with earnings, resulting in huge gyrations. For example, annual net income swelled to $81.42 billion in 2019 from $4.02 billion in 2018, a down year for stocks, while operating profit fell 3% to $23.97 billion. After taxes are factored in, Berkshire\\'s first-quarter net loss could rival quarterly losses of $44.9 billion posted by AOL Time Warner in 2002, or $42.5 billion by General Motors (NYSE: ) in 2007. Berkshire\\'s loss could grow further if it wrote down its 26.6% Kraft Heinz stake, which some analysts call overdue. But it would likely fall short of American International Group Inc\\'s (N: ) $61.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2008. Much of the weakness likely came in financials, where the value of Berkshire\\'s disclosed stakes in Bank of America Corp (N: ),   & Co (N: ) and   Co (N: ) fell about $27 billion in the quarter. Berkshire\\'s stake in Apple Inc (O: ), its largest holding, may have fallen nearly $9 billion. Another $5 billion may have disappeared from stakes in the four biggest U.S. carriers:   Inc (O: ), Delta Air Lines Inc (N: ), Southwest Airlines Co (N: ) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O: ). And Occidental Petroleum Co (N: ) sank 72%, stung by plunging oil prices and leverage after it bought Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE: ), which Berkshire helped fund with $10 billion of preferred stock throwing off $800 million of annual dividends. FOOD NOURISHES Quarterly results are expected around May 2 when Berkshire holds its annual meeting, though the pandemic forced Buffett to cancel the surrounding \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" a weekend of events that normally draw more than 40,000 people to Omaha. At least four Berkshire-owned stocks rose last quarter. Perhaps unsurprisingly, all are associated with consumer staples or healthcare, sectors that many investors expect to outperform in down markets. They included retailer Amazon.com Inc (O: ), biotechnology company Biogen Inc (O: ), kidney dialysis provider   (N: ) and grocer   (N: ). Another grocer in Berkshire\\'s portfolio, Costco Wholesale Corp (O: ), fell just 3%. It remains unclear how the pandemic might let Buffett whittle Berkshire\\'s $128 billion cash pile. Buffett prefers buying whole companies to stocks, but has not made an \"elephant\" sized acquisition since 2016. He could also offer lifelines to companies, as he did during the 2008-2009 financial crisis for   Co (N: ),   Inc (N: ) and even Harley-Davidson Inc (N: ). Shanahan said Buffett could find many new places to invest. \"I would be super-disappointed if he didn\\'t put tens of billions of dollars of his capital to work in the first half of this year,\" he said.

Healthcare ( ) has held up better than most S&P 500 sectors. Since the S&P 500 hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, healthcare is down about 18% as of Wednesday, while the benchmark index ( ) has tumbled 27%. The sector is typically considered a defensive area of the market because some investors believe consumers will continue buying healthcare products even during uncertain times.  Shares of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have led the pack, including those working on potential treatments and other ways to address the rapidly spreading outbreak. In particular, shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O: ) and   (O: ) have risen 24% and 8%, respectively, since the S&P hit its peak.  \"A lot of these companies are working on a solution to the problem,\" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. \"We can debate what it means to them ... monetarily, but perception-wise they are viewed as a safe haven because of that.\" Greenwood Capital in recent weeks bought shares of Regeneron and Roche Holding AG (S: ), a Swiss company that has diagnostics and a potential therapy for the new coronavirus. The purchases added to the firm\\'s overweight position in healthcare, although it has pared its sector holdings during the recent outperformance, Todd said. Healthcare lagged the market\\'s big gains in 2019. Institutional investors generally held a lower weighting in healthcare relative to benchmark indexes before the pandemic took hold this year, said Rebecca Chesworth, senior equities strategist at   (NYSE: ) Global Advisors. Healthcare \"has been one of the most popular places to put money in the past couple of weeks,” she added. The sector recently traded at 12.9 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared to 14 times for the overall S&P 500, according to Refinitiv Datastream. Pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co (N: ) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (O: ), make up eight of the sector\\'s top ten performers since Feb. 19, all of which have gained or fallen far less than the broader market. “In general, if you are on a drug, you are staying on that drug,\" said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager who focuses on healthcare at Fred Alger Management. \"So that part of their business is pretty safe.” Some areas of the sector have been hit hard by the vast ripple effects of the virus, particularly medical device companies dependent on elective procedures that are being delayed to preserve hospital capacity and resources for coronavirus patients. Shares of Zimmer Biomet Holdings (N: ) and   Corp (N: ), which make knee and hip replacements, are down 44% and 36%, respectively, since Feb 19. Shares of hospital chain HCA Healthcare Inc (N: ) have slumped 44% over that period as hospitals lose high-margin elective procedures and cope with severe disruption from the influx of coronavirus patients, said Jeff Jonas, healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds. Jonas, however, believes those areas could be quicker to recover than other parts of the economy when the pandemic recedes. \"You\\'re going to be more nervous about getting on a plane, staying in a hotel, going out to dinner in the aftermath of this then you are about going back to see your doctor or to get a procedure done,” he said.

Some point to easing volatility and improving liquidity in fixed-income markets as signs that the worst of the sell-off may be over. Investor sentiment, often seen as a contrarian indicator, is one signal pointing to an eventual turnaround in U.S. stocks. Still, markets remain turbulent and far off their highs.

U.S. futures were up more than 1 percent soon after opening on Sunday. Here is a roundup of some analyst and investor views from the past few days:  - Julian Emanuel at U.S. broker-dealer BTIG said in a research note on Sunday that if history is any sort of guide, he expects a \"retest of the March lows in April, as the public health and economic bad news is likely to reach its parabolic peak.\"  Emanuel said that part of what could make a bottom for stocks in the coming days is a realization that the real reopening date for the economy is not the end of April but rather the end of May.  Emanuel added that stocks often trough \"when the headlines are most adverse, hope scarce, and emotions high\" and said that as investors, \"we want to be ready for that time, and we think it is coming in April.\"  Emanuel pointed to one \"uncommon phenomenon indicative of systemic hedging,\" saying the S&P 500  , which measures volatility, is currently above the   VIX, which is \"usually reserved for times of market stress.\" - Whitney Tilson, founder and CEO of Empire Financial Research, a publisher of investment newsletters, who previously ran hedge fund Kase Capital, said in an email on Sunday that he believes New York City \"stopped the rapid spread of the virus around March 19,\" and that the number of new cases is now in decline. Tilson said data that NYC Health was releasing on new cases gave a more hopeful picture. - Christopher Wood at Jefferies wrote in a research note dated Friday that they are still expecting, at a minimum, \"a re-test of the previous low on the S&P 500\", as well as a re-test of the 10-year Treasury bond yield low, and forecasts that will coincide with a renewed rally in the U.S. dollar. Wood wrote that \"markets are heading into the peaking of the bad news in Europe at the same time as cases in Britain and America, both behind in terms of the virus cycle because of the failure to lockdown earlier, continue to rise sharply,\" Wood wrote. \"This news flow is likely to unnerve investors in the short-term for understandable reasons.\"  Still, Woods said \"when that peaking out does occur, it should generate a decent tradeable rally.\"  Jefferies equity strategist Steven DeSanctis, however, in a separate note said, said that hedge funds\\' de-risking \"seems to be behind us.\"  - Andrew Slimmon, managing director and senior portfolio manager on all long equity strategies at   (NYSE: ) Investment Management, said in emailed comments from a podcast on Friday that he also expects some \"retest of the lows\" but said it is possible that \"we will not get back to the lows.\"  He charts three stages of bear markets - the \"panic low,\" the \"relief rally\" and the \"retest\" and said the market is currently in the second stage. He sees financial services and consumer stocks as areas that are particularly attractive.  - Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, wrote in emailed comments on Friday that \"April is going to be a tough one, with lots of real — and very scary — headlines. The market will certainly respond to those headlines, so we should expect more volatility and quite possibly a retest of the March lows.\"  - Michael Purves, at Tallbacken Capital Advisors, wrote on Friday that the VIX curve appears to be reflecting a few high-level but important scenarios/risks, of rolling U.S. blackouts as incremental populations get hot, and that U.S. health policy is less cohesive than it is in other countries.  Purves also said there is \"an ever growing number of second order impacts from this economic shut down which may not reveal themselves for several months (fiscal stimulus implantation risks, food inflation, labor strikes, rising political risk, unsuccessful reboot of Asian economies, re-outbreak of Corona cases etc.)\"  (This story was refiled to add that Morgan Stanley comments were from a podcast)      Add a Comment'], ['(Bloomberg) -- The dispersion of Wall Street views on the outlook for stocks has been widening for a while, and Scott Minerd may have taken things up another notch.

First quarter results, which insurers begin reporting later in April, will test strategies and investment products, such as types of derivatives contracts, that insurers use to protect against risk in volatile markets, said S&P analyst Deep Banerjee. \"This is a good checkpoint to see if the protection that insurers have bought from themselves is working or not,\" Banerjee said. The industry has been taking on increasingly risky investments such as corporate bonds, hedge funds and hard assets like real estate for over a decade to offset low interest rates. But during the coronavirus rout, the riskiest investments have taken the biggest haircuts. For example, Bridgewater Associates LP, the RayDalio-led hedge fund firm famous for making money during the2008 financial crisis, posted double-digit losses as of March 18 amid sharp market declines sparked by the coronavirusoutbreak. But the performance of even some of the most challenged industries is better than life insurers. The S&P Life & Health Insurance index  First-quarter results could also reflect a sales slump, adding to concerns about falling asset values and low rates, analysts said. People buy fewer life-insurance products during a recession, plus working from home presents roadblocks for salespeople. \"There is less office time and less time to build your pipeline,\" said Piper Sandler analyst John Barnidge. Analysts have been lowering their estimates for the industry. Quarterly estimates for MetLife Inc (N: ) and Prudential Financial Inc (N: ) are down on average 6%, according to Refinitiv data. But Wall Street\\'s overall predictions do not reflect the full impact of the coronavirus because some analysts have not yet updated their models. \"There could be surprises,\" said Banerjee, noting that they would likely lead to lower results, not higher. All kinds of companies across the United States are facing coronavirus issues, as the government has told people to stay home, limited travel and required certain businesses to close. [https://tmsnrt.rs/2R7wWYX] The profit pressure life insurers are facing is nothing compared to what those at the center of the coronavirus pandemic are suffering, but it represents an unusual slice of corporate America. One might think a life insurer\\'s biggest challenge at this time would be that as many as 240,000 Americans might die from the coronavirus, according to a White House task force projection, leading to elevated claims. But the industry\\'s $4.2 trillion invested in markets that have gone haywire has become a more pressing concern, said Howard Mills, an independent senior adviser for Deloitte. Insurers will not have problems paying claims, as horrible as the pandemic is, because of significant cash that regulators make them set aside, said Mills. But investment returns are at the heart of insurers\\' profits. \"Zero percent interest rates are seriously compounding the challenge and will hit the bottom line directly,\" Mills said. \\xa0 Add a Comment'], [' ( ) bulls showed up early Monday morning and took full control of Bitcoin price by sending the price through the $6,900-$7,200 resistance zone to a nearly 4-week high of $7,454.

As companies around the world conserve cash by cutting dividends to survive the coronavirus pandemic, Chinese firms with stronger finances and state-backing hold out the prospect of being better able to sustain shareholder payouts. Brokers believe Chinese corporate dividends will be worth seeking out as bonds become less rewarding, China\\'s economy begins to recover quickly from the virus hit and officials continue with corporate reform to increase company payouts. \"Because the epidemic is better controlled in our country, we are more confident in the fundamentals of companies here,\" said Wang Wulei, an analyst at China Merchants Securities, who last month recommended seeking companies with payouts. Some 641 A-share companies have announced 774.5 billion yuan ($109.6 billion) of dividends, more than 20% of 2019 net profits, Wang\\'s analysis shows. The annualised return on the CSI dividend index, which tracks 100 stocks, was 3.3%.  By contrast, yields on 10-year Chinese government bonds ( ) fell to a fresh 17-year low of 2.503% on Tuesday, from 4.12% in January 2017. Many of China\\'s state-linked companies are leading the way on payouts. China Mobile (HK: ) last month lifted its 2019 dividend by 24% and pledged a steady payout in 2020. Despite pressures on margins, banks including Agricultural Bank of China (HK: ) (SS: ), Bank of China (HK: ) (SS: ), and oil producers Sinopec (HK: ) (SS: ) and PetroChina (HK: ) (SS: ) also pressed ahead with payout plans. \"Companies are announcing more attractive dividend policies,\" said Catherine Yeung, investment director at Fidelity International. \"But given the volatility, it might not be a key focus (for most investors) right now.\" Sheldon Zhang, Shanghai-based fund manager at Schroder Investment Management, said some long-term investors started switching from bonds in March, although the numbers were still relatively small. Chinese blue-chip shares ( ) fell 11.5% in their biggest quarterly drop since the end of 2018, but fared better than many. The S&P 500 ( ) dived 20%, for example, in its worst three months since the fourth quarter of 2008. Nomura\\'s analysis shows 48 of 100 top Chinese companies, excluding financial institutions, have net cash - where cash piles exceed their total debts - compared with just 18 of top firms in the United States. While some Chinese companies may cut dividends in the short term due to the global slowdown, sector leaders could expand market share and payouts, said Lirong Xu, chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton Sealand Fund Management in Shanghai. \"These companies have good business strategies, cashflows, and even though their dividend yields are currently low, they have plans to raise them,\" he added.

Regulators have for several years targeted so-called \"iron roosters\" - a term used for companies who do not pay dividends - as part of efforts to improve corporate governance by slowly weaning investors off their focus on quick capital appreciation instead of stable income. Yield-seeking investors have also typically bought wealth management products or money market funds but these opportunities are narrowing as interest rates fall. With interest rates likely to stay lower for longer, investors will seek better returns from other assets, such as high-yielding equities, said Lilian Leung, who manages JPMorgan (NYSE: ) Asset Management\\'s China income fund.

On Wednesday afternoon the first detailed accounts of that debate will be released when the central bank publishes minutes of the meetings at which policymakers slashed interest rates back to zero, broadened access to U.S. dollars for foreign central banks, and restarted the massive asset purchases that have come to define monetary policy in a crisis. If past practice is a guide, the minutes will provide detail on the Fed decisions announced on March 3 and March 15 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell convened emergency meetings as the scale of the pandemic and its risk to the U.S. economy became clear. The readout may also include their discussions of a slate of related actions that flowed from those two meetings. Barely five weeks before the surprise rate cut on March 3, Powell and his colleagues had wrapped up their first meeting of the year on Jan. 29 with an air of cautious optimism. It looked like 2020 could be a year of steady growth and continued strength in the job market, a fresh updraft after a rocky 2019 in which the Fed cut rates three times to blunt the effects of the Trump administration\\'s trade war with China. While broadly upbeat, policymakers did concede the novel coronavirus \"warranted close watching,\" according to minutes of that meeting released on Feb 19, the day before the U.S. stock market began a month-long crash that would cut its value by a third. Even through mid-February policymakers felt the outbreak of the new coronavirus strain in China would likely have minimal spillovers to the rest of the world, perhaps disrupting the supply of parts and final goods from Chinese factories but not posing much in the way of a broader threat. But the virus spread to the United States, the crisis deepened in China and elsewhere, and conventional economic models proved progressively less able to measure what was happening. The Fed then pulled its crisis playbook from a decade earlier off the shelf and began trying to stabilize financial markets that went from record highs to flashing red. Most Fed officials now agree the U.S. economy is in a recession that may cut U.S. output by double digits in the second quarter and throw 20 million people or more out of work, at least temporarily, due to measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.  Wednesday\\'s minutes may show just how dire a threat officials saw in those earliest moments and what spurred them to action.  ON THE FLY The first move came on Feb. 28.  With the S&P 500 Index ( ) tumbling 15% from its record high in just seven sessions and corporate credit spreads widening fast, Powell released an unscheduled statement at 2:30 p.m. pledging that Fed officials would \"use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\" The following Tuesday - March 3 - the Fed cut its benchmark lending rate by half a percentage point to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%. \"The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong,\" the U.S. central bank said. \"However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity.\" It was soon apparent that that would not be nearly enough and that officials could not wait until their next scheduled meeting - set for March 17 and 18 - to take further action. On March 15, the Sunday before that meeting, the Fed took its boldest action since the height of the financial crisis.  The central bank cut interest rates by a full point back to near zero and reintroduced a pledge to leave them there for the foreseeable future. It promised to buy at least $700 billion of bonds, and slashed the interest rate on its lender-of-last-resort facility for banks to just 0.25%. It also announced a coordinated action with five other central banks to pump much-needed dollars into their jurisdictions. How much beyond that will be covered in Wednesday\\'s minutes is unclear, but the Fed\\'s actions continued through the rest of the month. By the end of March, it would remove the lid on its bond purchases. It would also announce the launch of more than half a dozen new credit programs to keep key markets operating and even to get funds into the hands of smaller businesses excluded from international finance markets.

The Russell 2000 ( ) - where market capitalizations last year ranged from $150 million to $5 billion - has bounced 20% from its March lows, roughly in line with the S&P 500\\'s ( ) 23% gain from its recent trough.  Small-cap stocks are often seen as a barometer of investor sentiment and tend to be among the first to recover in an economic revival. The Russell 2000 index is down 29.7% from its recent February peaks.  Yet some believe betting on a sustained rebound in small caps could be a risky proposition, as the extent of damage from the coronavirus pandemic to the broader economy and smaller firms in particular remains uncertain.  \"The good news is, we’ve obviously seen a lot of the downside,\" said Jill Carey Hall, head of U.S. small- and mid-cap strategy at Bank of America (NYSE: ). \"That’s not to say there couldn’t be some further downside risk ahead.\"  Many small-cap stocks were already under a cloud before markets began their decline in February, with more stocks on the Russell 2000 showing higher debt levels and a smaller number reporting quarterly profits, according to Carey Hall. In aggregate, companies in the index currently have 4.5 times more debt than earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared with a ratio of 3.5 at the end of 2007. And 30% of Russell stocks were not able to report a profit for the last 12 months compared with 18% in 2007, Carey Hall said.  Additionally, 70% of small-cap debt is of the potentially riskier, high-yield variety, compared with 10% for larger-cap companies. Small caps also have a weighted average debt maturity of five years compared with nine years for large caps, meaning that small-cap debts will come due sooner, according to BofA.  \"There’s certainly going to be challenges where some small businesses might be at risk of going under,\" Carey Hall said.  Small-cap stocks have already indicated a recessionary environment. The relative forward price-to-earnings ratio of small cap to large cap recently hit its lowest level in nearly 20 years, well below the levels of the last recession.  Graphic - Russell 2000 Forward PE relative to Russell 1000: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgwyqpqd/RelativeRussell.jpg Since U.S. lockdowns did not start in many places until around mid-March, they will have the biggest impact only on the last two weeks of the calendar first quarter. But companies like retailers, whose fiscal first quarters go through April, will have seen more prolonged weakness by the time they report. \"One of the things you want to see is how stocks respond in April and May to both the awful economic news and the awful earnings,\" said Steven DeSanctis, small-cap strategist at Jefferies.  DeSanctis is watching whether the Russell can stay above the March 18 close, which was 991.16 - its lowest since February 2016. Some investors have pointed to signs that appetite for small caps may be growing. Recent gains in the Russell could be an early indication investors see the U.S. economy bouncing back faster than other economies, said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at   (NYSE: ) Investment Institute in St. Louis, Missouri.  But Wren still rates small caps unfavorably compared with large caps, citing issues such as difficulties accessing credit, stalling of buybacks and the economic slowdown due to lockdowns. Some money managers were also skeptical of the recent gains in the segment.  Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York, said smaller companies may take longer to bounce back because consumers are likely to wait for evidence of a medical solution to the pandemic before they resume spending. \"Big corporations can sustain this with their strong balance sheets. Small companies simply can\\'t,\" Blancato said.

Exxon paid a lower price to borrow than it did in a similar debt deal almost four weeks ago, a sign of how investor confidence is gradually returning after a rout in energy prices and a stock market collapse fueled by the coronavirus outbreak.  Nevertheless, borrowing costs for Exxon were still higher than prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Exxon raised $9.5 billion by selling five different bonds with a variety of durations ranging from five years to 31 years, up from $9 billion which it had originally planned to raise, indicating robust investor demand.  In an example of how the company\\'s borrowing costs have come down in recent weeks, it priced a 10.5-year bond worth $2 billion at a 185 basis-point premium to U.S. Treasuries with a 2.61% yield. On March 17, Exxon sold $2 billion in debt with a 10-year duration where the premium to U.S. Treasuries was 240 basis points and the yield was 3.482%. In August last year, Exxon raised $1.25 billion through a 10-year bond with a premium to U.S. Treasuries of just 75 basis points and a yield of 2.44%. The new issue by Exxon comes as highly rated U.S. companies have been tapping debt markets for cash at a record clip, stocking up on cash due to the uncertainty surrounding the economic impact from coronavirus. The logic behind Exxon\\'s deal was to stock up further on cash while the market is still open to issuers of new debt, according to a person familiar with the matter. Exxon\\'s stock has been hammered this year by the collapse in oil prices, with its share price down 38.7% so far in 2020, a steeper fall than the 14.5% drop in the benchmark S&P 500 Index.  In a regulatory filing, Exxon said it planned to use the proceeds for \"general corporate purposes.\" Oil prices were mixed on Monday, as the historic production-cut deal signed by major global oil producers was not enough to assuage existing worries about the demand destruction brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Other companies to issue new debt on Monday included U.S. industrial conglomerate   (NYSE: ) Co, drug store chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: ) Inc and movie theater operator Cinemark Holdings Inc.

Add a Comment'], ['By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and Sujata Rao LONDON (Reuters) - A dramatic jump in equity dividend futures amid the continued rush of dividend cuts from companies desperate to preserve cash is implying growing confidence that shareholder payouts could make a comeback after this year\\'s drought. Companies from almost every sector in most countries have been culling dividends as coronavirus-linked lockdowns hit revenues and cashflow. In many countries regulators have upped the pressure to cancel dividends and share buybacks at a time when many employees have been laid off or furloughed. But nothing lasts forever, investors are betting. That is reflected in dividend futures contracts -- derivatives that allow punters to cheaply bet on future payments and collect the difference if the dividend is paid. Such futures plunged around 60% last month in Europe as well as the United States. But since early April, dividend futures for 2021 on the S&P500 have bounced 26%  The rebound is partly driven by a view that betting on company payouts is less volatile than buying shares outright. But many also reckon that dividend pricing had become excessively bearish, especially if gigantic global policy stimulus fuels a speedy economic recovery. \"Our view is that in this crisis, dividends are cut this year and next but it doesn\\'t mean this will continue 3-4 years into the future,\" said Suhail Shaikh, chief investment officer at Fulcrum Asset Management in London.  Shaikh has bought dividend futures while selling underlying S&P 500 and Euro STOXX futures as \"in the next three years those dividend contracts could go up 50%\". As virus cases approach the 2 million mark globally, and many countries extend lockdown periods to contain the spread of the disease, total dividend cuts by U.S. and European firms for 2020 should be double the tally of 2008-09, JPMorgan (NYSE: ) predicts. That was the last time there was a sharp cut in dividends, which was triggered by the financial crisis. JPMorgan estimates that while 130 companies on the STOXX 600 ( ) have cut dividends and 16 on the S&P 500 ( ), another 30 firms in Europe will follow suit. In this gloom, it may indeed be optimistic to expect a dividend recovery next year. But futures imply 45-50% dividend discounts as far out as 2024, relative to consensus estimates,   (LON: ) noted late last week, describing this as \"too harsh\". JPMorgan strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou reckons the situation could normalise by 2022. \"It\\'s surprising how pessimistic investors are...

With few expecting a quick end to the market\\'s volatility, managers are seeking companies with strong balance sheets that can weather what could be a deep but short recession, according to a recent Reuters poll.  \"We are focused on the companies that we think will survive this cycle,\" said Eric Cinnamond, co-manager of the Palm Valley Capital Fund. The fund\\'s 0.79% gain during the first quarter made it one of just two actively managed U.S. equity funds tracked by Morningstar to show a positive return over the period. The small-cap focused fund began 2020 with more than 92% of its assets in cash as the sector\\'s valuations soared.

The Cboe Volatility Index ( ), known as \"Wall Street\\'s fear gauge,\" ended below 40 on Tuesday for the first time since March 5, after rising as high as 82.69 during a sell-off that took the S&P 500 down as much as 34% from its peak.  That 40 level is a significant one for some VIX watchers: The previous bull market began in March 2009, when the VIX fell to similar levels after having hit a closing high of 80.86 in November 2008.  Investors are digesting a rally in which the S&P 500 ( ) benchmark index has soared 24% from its March lows in the midst of the spreading coronavirus pandemic. While some market participants have taken heart from unprecedented stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government, few can predict when the state-by-state lockdowns that have virtually shut down the entire country will ease, what trajectory the pandemic will take or the scope of its damage to the economy. While plenty of uncertainty remains, the majority of options indicators \"are pointing in the right direction,\" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. Volatility crept higher on Wednesday. The VIX moved back above 40 as the S&P 500 ( ) fell following data on steep drops in U.S. retail sales and factory output. Even so, other bullish signals formed over the last few days have not been obscured. Movement in ratios comparing the volume of put options, used for downside protection, to that of call options, used to position for market gains, has suggested easing demand for portfolio hedges. One such measure, the ISEE Sentiment Index, jumped to its highest level since late November on Monday, even as U.S. stocks fell. VIX futures also reflect expectations that the coming weeks are unlikely to feature the sort of turbulence that rocked markets in March. The inversion - or backwardation - of the VIX futures term structure, in which prices for front-month contracts are higher than those for later-dated contracts, has become less steep over the past few weeks. Graphic - Flattening the curve: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbwyrvqz/SPX%20v%20VIX%20futures%20spread.jpg Yet there are few signs that markets will soon return to the kind of placid trading that was a hallmark of the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak. The term structure has not reverted to its usual upward slope, where later-dated contracts are more expensive than earlier-dated ones, indicating that expectations of near-term volatility persist, analysts said. At the same time, benign configurations in VIX futures have not always held up, analysts warned.  In March 2008, for instance, the term structure flattened after the VIX momentarily peaked amid the collapse of Bear Stearns, but it eventually inverted again. Stocks made deeper lows in October of that year amid the fallout from the global financial crisis. \"There\\'s still uncertainty about whether front-month volatility spikes again,\" said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. Other strategists have noted that as the term structure has flattened, volatility expectations have stayed high for later months, in a possible signal of concerns about lingering effects of the coronavirus outbreak. The first-quarter earnings season could also ratchet up market turbulence, especially when smaller, more volatile companies report results, said Matt Amberson, principal at ORATS. \"We\\'re not out of the woods from a volatility standpoint,\" he said.

The anticipation of economies opening up is helping sentiment. And while investors are looking for where to put cash to work, there were already some signs this week that many are following an old market friend. Also this week, leading indicators took on more prominence than maybe ever before. And if you dug deep enough into the Fed’s Beige Book, not everything there was negative. Here are three things that flew under the radar this week. 1.  Earlier this week, President Donald Trump outlined a three-pronged approach to get the wheels of the economy turning once again. And investors appear hungry to put money to work. But as the debate over value versus growth heats up, some on Wall Street are keeping it simple. \"Follow the Fed,\" Blackrock (NYSE: ) said earlier this week in a blog post. \"We will follow the Fed and other (developed market) central banks by purchasing what they’re purchasing, and assets that rhyme with those,\" said Rick Rieder, head of BlackRock’s global allocation team. For years, investors have invested safely in the knowledge that when financial conditions turn ugly, the Fed will turn up to save the day. Just a few months ago in October, the Fed stepped up purchases of short-term debt to calm overnight lending markets, a move that many believe led to a months-long rally before the pandemic erupted. Over the past month the Fed has gone on a shopping spree that took its balance sheet above $7 trillion, so far, in a bid to stave off a coronavirus-led economic crisis that some have claimed could rival the deepest and darkest downturns of yesteryear. A myriad of asset purchases including Treasuries, investment-grade debt, ETFs and junk bonds made the list. And with the well of Fed stimulus thought to be bottomless, others on Wall Street are also keeping one eye on the central bank\\'s shopping list despite the underlying economy showing recession symptoms, with record jobless claims over the past four weeks. \"Corporate bond spread analysis shows that credit investors are already changing their buying patterns to focus on sectors \\'adopted\\' by the Fed,\"   (NYSE: ) said in a note. Investors ramped up U.S. junk bond purchases to a record $7.66 billion in the week to April 15, according to Refinitiv Lipper. \"You can thank the Fed,\" Greg Zappin, a money manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management, told Bloomberg. \"High-yield spreads have tightened about 300 basis points and the market is open to issuance, so I’m not surprised money is flowing in.\" The Conference Board’s monthly measure of   is usually a barnburner when it comes to moving the market. The Conference Board’s own   gets much more attention, for example. But with the markets fixated on how bad things could get from a global economic shutdown, the more forward-looking the numbers are the better. Friday’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) says things are historically bad. The LEI sank 6.7% to 104.2 in March, compared with a 0.2% drop in February. “In March, the U.S. LEI registered the largest decline in its 60-year history,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, senior director of economic research at The Conference Board, in a press release. “The unprecedented and sudden deterioration was broad based, with the largest negative contributions coming from initial claims for unemployment insurance and stock prices,” Ozyildirim said. “The sharp drop in the LEI reflects the sudden halting in business activity as a result of the global pandemic and suggests the U.S. economy will be facing a very deep contraction.” Thee components the composite index include average manufacturing hours, jobless claims, new orders volume, ISM new orders, capital goods orders, building permits, the  , M2 money supply, interest rates spread and consumer expectations for business conditions. While the data remain historically bad across several indicators, there were some anecdotal green shoots across several regions in the Federal Reserve’s   of the economy out this week. “One tourism contact reported that coastal communities that rely on seasonal business are cautiously optimistic about a snap-back in visitors who are driving-distance away soon after advisories are lifted, reflecting pent-up demand from cancellation of planned vacations throughout the spring.” “Looking ahead, contacts in manufacturing, finance, and professional & business services said they expect staffing levels to hold steady from current levels.” “According to several firms with global perspectives, supply chain issues with China have eased, and China is mostly back to work.” “One egg farmer said that (a spike in demand) probably saved many farmers as selling prices had been depressed in recent months.” “Despite the decline in (manufacturing) activity, some firms suggested that new orders were holding steady or even increasing due to changes in product demand. Supply delivery times were reported to be increasing.” “A contact in southern Wisconsin reported greater demand from restaurants for remodeling work as owners anticipated eventually reopening.” “Wheat demand and prices rose due to increased purchases of breads and pastas during the coronavirus pandemic … in the livestock side, pasture conditions were favorable and prices for cattle ready for feedlots rose because of pandemic-related increased demand for beef.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions. Demonstrations to demand an end to stay-at-home measures spread to Texas on Saturday. Trump appeared to encourage protesters with a series of Twitter posts on Friday calling for them to \"LIBERATE\" Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, all run by Democratic governors. Trump has touted a thriving economy as the best case for his re-election in November. Several states, including Ohio, Michigan, Texas and Florida, have said they aim to reopen parts of their economies, perhaps by May 1 or even sooner, but appeared to be staying cautious. Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday the U.S. had the capacity to do a sufficient amount of testing for states to move into a phase one of reopening, but Governors and state health officials say there is nowhere near enough test kits and equipment available.

But not everyone is buying the bounce.  The S&P 500 ( ) closed on Friday at 2,874, more than 28% above its recent trough reached on March 23 and just under 18% below its record high close reached on Feb. 19. That rally has been spurred by the U.S. central bank going into overdrive to try to keep the economy from suffering lasting damage, as well as a $2.3 trillion federal stimulus package. Investors and analysts have turned more positive. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) last week said the unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions by the Fed and Congress had \"precluded the prospect of a complete economic collapse,\" meaning its previous near-term downside forecast for the S&P of 2000 was no longer likely. Andrew Sheets, a strategist at   (NYSE: ), wrote in a research note that the economic downturn \"will be more severe, but less prolonged\" than the financial crisis, but he expects the economy to hit its low point in the second quarter. If that is the case, Sheets said, \"it\\'s very reasonable that the low for equity/credit prices happens before that.\" The stockmarket has changed its mood swiftly since March 23 - when the S&P 500 dropped as much as 35% below its Feb. 19 peak. But trading has been volatile. Since then the index has closed up more than 1% in ten sessions with its biggest daily gain at 9.4% on March 24. It has fallen more than 1% six times and the deepest cut was 4.4% on April 1.  Other risk assets have also benefited: Junk-rated bonds saw record inflows of $10.5 billion in the week to Wednesday, BofA said on Friday. The turnaround in optimism comes against an awful economic picture. Data on Thursday showed a record 22 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits over the past month, manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region plunged to levels last seen in 1980 and homebuilding tumbling by the most in 36 years in March. That followed dismal reports of a record drop in retail sales in March and the biggest decline in factory output since 1946.  Some investors are arguing for more focus on fundamentals such as corporate earnings.  \"The market\\'s forecasting can be error-prone and currently there is little mention of head fakes, value traps, potentially impotent policies, and significant later-order effects,\" Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors, wrote in a report late on Friday. He thinks we are in only the first phase of a bear market.  Bernstein says fundamentals, not short-term technicals or FOMO - meaning fear-of-missing out, \"will ultimately determine the direction of the markets.\" Chris Beauchamp, analyst at online trading firm IG, said investors \"continue to be confounded by the strength of the rebound in stock markets, which have apparently decided that the coronavirus crisis is receding in intensity.\" However, he said that with earnings season intensifying this week, \"the rally faces more hurdles.\"  (NYSE: )\\'s chief U.S. equity strategist, Tobias Levkovich, wrote that he worried about \"sentiment moving out of panic so rapidly\" in what he described as a \"somewhat treacherous\" and volatile investment environment.  While policy moves like those by the Fed and congressional stimulus programs may deserve big reactions if risks are removed, Levkovich says he is looking at fundamentals and worries about \"difficult-to-assess issues such as the potential for second wave infection outbreaks as the economy re-opens.\"  Investors have also been reassured by signs U.S. coronavirus cases may be peaking and on Friday stocks were buoyed by a report that COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms had responded well to a drug from Gilead Sciences (O: ) even though full trial data for that drug had yet to been analyzed. ( ) Russell Price, Ameriprise\\'s chief economist, sees government stimulus, reports of virus treatments advances and signs of peaking infections as good reasons for the more positive stock market, but he expects the U.S. economy to take between six and eight quarters to get back to where it was at the end of 2019.  \"What\\'s not fully been embraced is how difficult it\\'s going to be to get the economy up to speed,\" said Price. \"What the market doesn\\'t seem to be appreciating is how long it takes.\" Bernstein argues that if economic progress in China - the first country to report coronavirus cases- is any guide it doesn\\'t bode that well for the U.S economy in the near term. \"China\\'s path has been very saucer-shaped at best,\" according to Bernstein which notes that the country is about 50 days ahead of the United States in its outbreak and recovery. Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, is also skeptical of the rally.  \"You don\\'t fight the Fed. You have the momentum people are chasing,\" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey, who is also skeptical of the rally. \"Is it fundamentally justified, absolutely not.\"       Add a Comment'], ['By Marc Jones and Wayne Cole LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Caution recaptured world markets on Monday as another drubbing for U.S. crude oil futures kicked off a week of data and earnings that will drive home the damage being inflicted by global coronavirus lockdowns.

The S&P 500 ( ) has still rallied 30% from its March low, thanks in part to the extreme easing steps taken by the Federal Reserve. The Fed has bought nearly $1.3 trillion of Treasuries alone, and many billions of non-sovereign debt it would historically have never gone near. \"The question is, are markets underestimating this in terms of the long-term impact on the economy. There will be damage and there will be damage in terms of the consumer psyche,\" Rabobank\\'s de Groot said.  That damage should become all more clear this week with April global purchasing manager data - seen as some of the most forward-looking economic gauges - being published on Thursday. A taster on Monday was that Japan reported its exports down almost 12% in March from a year earlier, with shipments to the United States down over 16%.

Italy\\'s borrowing costs rose meanwhile, heading back towards last week\\'s one-month highs, reflecting unease before a European Union summit later this week over how to tackle the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis.  Selling pressure on Italian government bonds has returned in the past week, undoing some of the benefits of the European Central Bank\\'s massive bond-buying scheme, after euro zone politicians failed to agree to common debt issuance as a means of addressing the crisis.

The S&P energy index ( ) tumbled 4% after the front-month May U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) contract ( ) turned negative - unprecedented in history - with sellers offering buyers $37.63 a barrel. With much of the global economy suspended due to the coronavirus, physical demand for crude has dried up, creating a global supply glut as billions of people stay home.  “What the energy market is telling you is that demand isn’t coming back anytime soon, and there’s a supply glut,\" said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at WisdomTree Asset Management in New York. \"This price decline can be good if it means more people going to the pump, but that requires people getting out.” Weathering the broad market sell-off, Amazon (O: ) rose 1.6% and Netflix (O: ) jumped 4%.

Worries over the economic hit from the virus slammed riskier assets in February and March. Still, hedge funds outperformed the market, with the HFRX Equity Hedge index down 9.58% in March, compared with a 12.5% decline for the S&P 500 Index. \"In long/short equity there is a small amount of re-risking that has been going on for the last two weeks but not back to the risk levels that we saw in February or the start of March,\" said Rob Christian co-head of research and investment management at hedge fund solutions group K2 Advisors, part of Franklin Templeton Investments. \"Managers are being selective, buying good, solid businesses that have cash flow going forward and\\xa0shorting indexes or weak companies,\" he said. U.S. stock markets have partially rebounded from the trough of 2,191.86, touched by the S&P 500 ( ) on March 23, and through Monday, had risen 30% from that low. Hedge funds have followed suit in rebuilding risk.  One way to measure hedge funds\\' risk taking is to track their equity\\xa0beta\\xa0sensitivity - or their sensitivity to equity market movements. For fundamental value hedge funds globally, net exposure to developed market stocks as measured by their 30-day rolling beta recently stood at about 0.8, compared with under 0.7 at end-January, according to Nomura.  For U.S.-based hedge funds, net leverage - a measure of how much risk they are taking as they chase returns - fell during the March selloff to the lowest it has been since 2010 but \"both gross and net (leverage) have bounced back,\" according to a recent report by   (NYSE: )\\'s prime brokerage team. Funds relying on systematic strategies such as risk parity and commodity trading advisors (CTAs), which were partly blamed for aggravating the recent selloff by off-loading risk when the markets were most vulnerable, have also been buyers recently, analysts said. Despite the buying by some hedge fund styles, macro hedge funds, which place bets on macroeconomic trends using index, currency and interest rate strategies, have remained sellers. \"The stock market is still in the midst of a standoff between technically oriented CTAs and fundamentals-focused macro investors,\" Masanari Takada, cross-asset strategist at Nomura Securities, said in a note on Thursday. If global macro funds join the buying spree it could give the stock market another leg up. MAX FEAR PASSED  Some funds that are betting on the market retesting its lows are still looking to do some buying in certain areas. James McDonald, CEO at Los Angeles-based alternative investment manager Hercules Investments has a trade which would profit from the stock market dropping back to March lows. While a majority of his buying would occur once such a pullback materializes, the fund has been making \"incremental buys,\" McDonald said.  He likes the U.S. Global Jets ETF (P: ), the VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF BJK (O: ) and the iShares Expanded Tech-Software ETF (Z: ), among others as recovery plays. Funds running the risk parity strategy, which automatically allocate money to major asset classes based on signals such as volatility levels, were particularly hard hit during the volatility spike in March. Funds with a volatility target of greater than 10% and less than 15%, logged a loss of 12.3% for the month of March, their worst monthly loss since October 2008, according to the HFR Risk Parity Index. Now that systematic funds have started adding to risk, they may well help support the rally by being incremental buyers as volatility settles, said Damien Bisserier, partner at Advanced Research Investment Solutions, a Los-Angeles based investment management and consulting firm managing about $12 billion in assets. Bisserier, however, warned that markets are likely to remain choppy in the near term. Dev Kantesaria, portfolio manager at equity hedge fund manager Valley Forge Capital Management (VFCM) in Wayne, Pennsylvania, said he thought \"the maximum fear around coronavirus has passed.\"  VFCM, which was down 4.9% for the Jan-March quarter, compared with a 13.3% fall for the HFRX Equity Hedge index, according to the fund, has been adding to its positions in companies with strong organic growth such as ratings agency Moody\\'s Corp (N: ), payments company Mastercard Inc (N: ) and credit scoring firm Fair Isaac Corp (N: ). \"I expect to see an increase in risk-on exposures as managers are positioning for a slowing rate of virus contagion growth,\" said Ken Heinz, president of Hedge Fund Research.

The world\\'s largest streaming service gained 15.8 million paying customers from January through March, bringing its global total to 182.9 million. Netflix had predicted it would add 7 million during the period. The company warned that it expected fewer new subscribers from July to December compared with a year earlier, however. Many people who would have joined then are likely to have already signed up, executives said.  \"We expect viewing to decline and membership growth to decelerate as home confinement ends,\" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders. The company is among the few businesses to benefit from government orders imposed in March to keep people away from each other in order to stop the spread of the highly infectious novel coronavirus. While the S&P 500 Index ( ) has fallen 19% from its Feb. 19 record high, Netflix has gained 11% during the same period.  Netflix also issued a bullish forecast that it would add 7.5 million new customers for the current quarter, which ends in June, though the company said it was \"mostly guesswork\" given uncertainty over when stay-at-home orders might be lifted. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected 3.8 million. Investing.com senior analyst Haris Anwar said Netflix\\'s big gains showed \"it\\'s the ultimate stay-at-home stock.\" \"That said, there\\'s no guarantee that a global recession and increased competition won\\'t hit Netflix in the latter part of the year,\" Anwar said. \"There\\'s little clarity from the company about the future, and that\\'s likely to hurt the stock in the short run.\" Netflix said the shutdown of film and TV production around the world had temporarily increased its free cash flow but could delay some programming by a quarter. In the second quarter, the impact will be \"modest\" and mostly will affect dubbing in various languages, the company said.  Most programming for 2020, and much of 2021, already has been filmed and is being finished remotely in post-production, Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a post-earnings interview with an analyst. \"We don\\'t anticipate moving the schedule around much, certainly not in 2020,\" Sarandos said. For the just-ended quarter, Netflix\\'s earnings per share fell short of analyst expectations. The company posted diluted earnings per share of $1.57, below the $1.65 consensus, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total revenue rose to $5.77 billion from $4.52 billion. Analysts on average had expected $5.76 billion. Appreciation of the U.S. dollar, due partially to the coronavirus crisis, dragged on international revenue, the company said. In the quarter, Netflix true-crime documentary \"Tiger King,\" about a colorful Oklahoma zookeeper, became a cultural sensation. It also released reality show \"Love is Blind,\" and a new season of Spanish-language thriller \"Money Heist.\"  As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive with the debut of Walt   Co\\'s (N: ) Disney+ and upcoming rivals. That has pushed Netflix to look for growth overseas. The company\\'s biggest expansion from January through March came from Europe, where it added 4.4 million new customers.  The most popular Netflix plan in the United States costs $13, nearly double the $7-per-month cost for Disney+. Netflix does not currently plan to raise its prices given the global pandemic, Chief Product Officer Greg Peters said. \"At this point we are not even thinking about price increases,\" Peters said.

With no direct exposure to oil, airlines or other sectors battered by the pandemic, the Swiss Market Index ( ) is down less than 10% since the beginning of the year. The pan-European STOXX 600 ( ) index has slumped 21% in the same period. Switzerland is home to the world\\'s biggest food group Nestle (S: ) and pharmaceutical giants Roche (S: ) and   (S: ), all of whose earnings typically hold up even when markets are in turmoil and economic indicators turning south. Graphic - European stocks by countries: Switzerland outperforms: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/oakpekwxprd/Pasted%20image%201587504345436.png Nestle, Roche and Novartis make up over 70% of the blue-chip index, which has a market capitalisation of 1.16 trillion Swiss francs ($1.2 trillion). The trio are the biggest companies by market value in Europe. Nestle, known globally for its packaged products like Maggi soups, KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe instant coffee, has been a top pick for investors while restrictions to contain the virus are forcing people around the world to stay at home. \"Markets that are more heavily weighted in defensives in general and pharmaceuticals in particular (Switzerland notably) tend to outperform, while countries heavily weighted in banks and oil and gas tend to lag (typically Italy, France or Norway),\" Makor Capital Markets strategist Stéphane Barbier de la Serre said. Healthcare and foods have clearly found favour with investors since mid-February, when the virus broke out in Europe, leading to much smaller losses than for banks, car makers or travel and leisure stocks. Within those sectors, Swiss names have been the top picks.

The forward P/E for Europe\\'s STOXX 600 ( ) is at 14.6, not far from the 15.3 level it reached on Feb. 26, and well above its recent low of 11.1 in March, based on Refinitiv\\'s data. Meanwhile, analysts expect earnings for S&P 500 companies to drop 17.9% in 2020 from the previous year, the IBES data shows. That is much steeper than the 3.5% decline estimated at the start of the month. \"In certain cases, the valuations are not necessarily showing the true picture,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.  First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are expected to have declined 14.8% from the year-ago quarter, while second-quarter earnings are forecast to fall 33.3%. Analysts\\' earnings expectations could fall further, giving investors further reason to question current multiples. Strategists see problems with European equity valuations as well. \"The P may be a little bit higher but not too stretched,\" said Michael Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. \"It\\'s more that, it\\'s that the E is probably too optimistic.\" Referring to the current forward P/E for European equities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) strategists wrote in a note: \"If we think that the bottom-up consensus is too high, then this is pretty meaningless.\"  Figuring out the extent to which the virus outbreak has hurt corporate profits has been difficult for analysts since many companies have been pulling guidance. But the Federal Reserve\\'s stimulus could pave the way for even higher multiples. \"The Fed has picked up the mantle of \\'whatever it takes,\\' and so has Congress,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE: ) in Newark, New Jersey. \"So between monetary and fiscal policy, they have crossed into each other\\'s realms to help cushion the economy, so the economy can come back as quickly as possible.\"       Add a Comment'], ['By Sinéad Carew (Reuters) - Investors are pinning their hopes for the reopening of the U.S. economy on the potential for wider availability of testing for COVID-19 cases and on drug trials for treatments of the deadly disease but said, until there is concrete progress in these areas, further stock market gains may be limited. Much of the S&P 500\\'s ( ) almost 27% advance above its March 23 low has been due to hopes that massive U.S. fiscal and monetary support would dampen the economic blow from stay-at-home orders designed to contain the coronavirus pandemic. But recently, the index has reacted to reports about trials and in particular Gilead Science\\'s (O: ) remdesivir experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to keep a virus from replicating and overwhelming a patient\\'s immune system. This volatility highlights investor impatience for indications of when state and Federal authorities might start to ease stay-at-home orders and get people back to work.  So far there are no approved treatments or vaccines for the disease which has killed over 190,000 people globally, according to a Reuters tally. The disease has infected more than 928,000 people and killed more than 52,000 in the United States alone, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Any sentiment around a therapy is really moving markets because it shapes expectations for a return to normalcy which would be needed to get an economic recovery started,\" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey. The S&P added to gains on Friday after the lead investigator in a U.S. government trial of remdesivir told Reuters the trial may yield results as early as mid-May. But on Thursday the index temporarily pared gains after a report Gilead\\'s drug failed a trial the drugmaker itself deemed inconclusive because the study was ended early. On April 17 investors were encouraged after medical news publication STAT reported rapid improvements in COVID-19 patients in one hospital studying the drug. While Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut is encouraged by the number of researchers working on coronavirus treatments, he is cautious about the stock market\\'s near-term prospects. \"The only thing that pushes us above this range in a sustainable way is a therapeutic solution or a vaccine that allows us to return to the pre-crisis level of business,\" he said. \"I think we\\'ll get a medical solution. The big question is the time frame. The longer it takes it becomes harder (for the economy) to snap back and rebound.\" While there are more than 70 vaccines in development for coronavirus, Manulife Investment Management\\'s Steven Slaughter, who manages a roughly $3.5 billion dedicated healthcare fund said he expects development of a successful vaccine to take at least 12-18 months compared to the average vaccine development time of 5-7 years.  Then it could be years before pharmaceutical companies can produce enough to vaccinate the world\\'s entire population.  But Slaughter is optimistic at least some treatment will be validated in trials in the next three to six months, and said this would give officials \"more latitude to restart the economy.\"  He said there are four main types of treatments being tested by companies including Gilead, Takeda Pharmaceutical (T: ), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (O: ) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (O: ) that all hold some promise.  While treatments may not necessarily slow transmission of the disease, they could help doctors control the severity of infections, easing pressure on intensive care units (ICU). \"If we can take a patient that otherwise would\\'ve spend 2-3 weeks in an ICU bed out of that ICU bed in 2-3 days that has an enormous beneficial impact on our ability to handle outbreaks or to handle a potential second wave of infections,\" he said.  In the meantime officials should at least look for greater availability of tests that can detect virus infections and for ways to track and trace people who might have been exposed, before easing lockdowns, some strategists said. \"What will be more critical will be the testing capacity and the efficacy of track and trace programmes,\" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Management. Test developers include   (N: ) and Roche Holding (S: ). Since much of the U.S. population has been told to stay at home and many businesses have been on pause since the middle of March, investors have already accounted for dismal earnings and a massive U.S. economic decline in the second quarter. But recent S&P gains seem to imply a huge improvement in the economy in the third quarter, according to Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"There will be a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19 but people are underestimating the amount of time it takes for them to reach the market,\" said Tuz. \"If there are disappointments in three areas - vaccine, treatment and testing - we could back track some in the market.\"      Add a Comment'], [], ['By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market has recovered because of the Federal Reserve\\'s actions but a retest of the recent lows is possible, Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said in a CNBC interview on Monday. \"I think we take out the low,\" the bond investor said. DoubleLine had about $148 billion in assets as of Dec. 31.

In recent months, the Fed has slashed rates to near zero, restarted bond purchases and rolled out an unprecedented range of programs to keep credit flowing and shore up business and household confidence, as the central bank tried to offset the economic hit from the coronavirus outbreak. The Fed\\'s actions may have led to over-valued assets, Gundlach warned.  He singled out the iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (P: ), in particular, saying the ETF \"looks to be the most over-valued asset in the bond market.\" LQD is up about 23% since hitting a low on March 19, boosted by the Fed\\'s move to buy corporate bonds through exchange-traded funds.

With more mom-and-pop investors chasing overseas stock investments that were until now a hobby of the wealthy, brokers that help investors navigate these trades through India\\'s highly restrictive cross-border investment rules are thriving. Vested Finance, an investment firm that helps Indians buy or sell U.S. stocks, opened 4,000 new accounts in March, double that in February. The company usually sees a 30% rise in account openings each month. Pranav Mehta, who owns an electronic parts manufacturing company, is one such investor. As his business hit a downturn, Mehta bought one share each of Amazon.com (O: ), Adobe (O: ), Microsoft (O: ), NVIDIA (O: ) and Mastercard (N: ) last year.  \"Technology is the future,\" Mehta said. \"If you want exposure to technology, you have to bag U.S. stocks.\" Mehta, 45, bought more shares last month as widespread restrictions around the world to limit the spread of coronavirus sent markets tumbling.  \"I jumped at the opportunity and increased my holdings more than four-fold,\" Mehta told Reuters. As markets recover from the pandemic, he wants U.S. stocks to be a fifth of his portfolio, up from 5% now. Vested Finance saw flows of more than $3.5 million into U.S. markets from India in the three months to March, a five-fold jump from the previous quarter and mostly from clients investing in the United States for the first time.  \"What\\'s interesting about U.S. stocks is that you not only get exposure to the United States but also to the world, as many companies have global operations but are listed there,\" said Viram Shah, co-founder and CEO of Vested Finance.  While most retail investors are interested in high profile brands such as Facebook (O: ), Google (O: ) and Netflix (O: ), Shah said, some have sought sectors such as cannabis and gene-editing CRISPR technology that are not available in India. India\\'s equity markets ( ) ( ) have lost more than a fifth of their value this year, while the S&P 500 ( ) has corrected by just over 11%. The S&P 500 also has almost no correlation with India\\'s markets, making it an ideal hedge for domestic investors.

The effect on those who were given it at a later stage were not as positive.\\xa0\\xa0 Interest in Gilead's drug has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for Covid-19, something that analysts say leaves the global economy vulnerable to secondary waves of infection over the next year or two. Gilead stock rose 5.9% at opening to within a couple of percent of the two-year high it earlier in April.

The meeting and surrounding festivities that Buffett calls \"Woodstock for Capitalists\" normally draw more than 40,000 people to Omaha, Nebraska to see and hear one of the world\\'s richest people and most revered investors. But Berkshire has scrapped most of this year\\'s fun, and Buffett fans will need their computers and smartphones to watch the Saturday afternoon meeting, broadcast on Yahoo (NASDAQ: ) Finance.  Buffett, who is Berkshire\\'s chairman and chief executive officer, has been notably quiet about the coronavirus, ever since calling the COVID-19 outbreak and plunging oil prices \"a big one-two punch\" in early March. He has also eschewed the kind of splashy investments, such as in   Inc (N: ), he made during in the 2008 financial crisis. Shareholders nonetheless said they expect Buffett to show Berkshire can successfully weather a deep recession. \"He\\'s an optimist,\" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management LLC, who invests 11% of assets he oversees in Berkshire stock. \"He will reflect on the country\\'s resilience, and how we\\'ll overcome this, as we have overcome so many other challenges. That\\'s how he looks at the world.\" ABEL TAKES STAGE Buffett, 89, will be joined by Greg Abel, 57, a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire\\'s non-insurance operating businesses, in answering shareholder questions at the meeting. Abel and Ajit Jain, another vice chairman, have long been viewed as Buffett\\'s likeliest successors as CEO. Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally answers shareholder questions with Buffett, and Jain, 68, will not be in attendance. Unlike Abel, both live far from Omaha. Berkshire is also likely on Saturday morning to report a huge first-quarter net loss, as investments such as   (N: ), Bank of America (N: ) and the four largest U.S. airlines sank in value. Many investors will focus on the quarterly performance of Berkshire\\'s more than 90 operating businesses, which in 2019 posted an average $6 billion of quarterly profit. The pandemic\\'s impact may be evident in falling volumes at the BNSF railroad, premium waivers and lower accident claims at the Geico auto insurer, and store closures by retailers such as See\\'s Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart.  \"As goes Berkshire, so goes the economy,\" said Lawrence Cunningham, a George Washington University law professor who has published several books on Berkshire. UNDERPERFORMANCE PERSISTS Investors will also look for how far Berkshire dipped into its $128 billion year-end cash hoard, whether through investments in other stocks or repurchases of its own. Munger told The Wall Street Journal two weeks ago that Berkshire\\'s phone is not \"ringing off the hook\" with companies seeking support. Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, likened the environment to the 1974 bear market, when Buffett told Forbes magazine he felt like an \"oversexed man in a harem\" when looking for investment opportunities. Berkshire, however, was then far smaller than the $461 billion behemoth it has become. \"You can\\'t pour water from a barrel into a teacup,\" Smead said, while adding he wished Buffett would admit stockpiling cash was a mistake: \"He needs to work for the benefit of those who, like him, have over 90% of their net worth in the company.\" Through Wednesday, Berkshire\\'s stock price was down 16% in 2020, versus a 9% drop in the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 ( ). And last year, Berkshire lagged the index by 20.5 percentage points, including dividends. Berkshire said Buffett and Abel will not be given shareholder questions in advance, and will not talk about specific Berkshire investments. That suggests that Berkshire\\'s holdings in banks, airlines and Apple Inc (O: ) may be off-limits. Cunningham said it will be important for Abel to show how his core values align with Berkshire\\'s, and to \"convey a sense of himself.\"      Add a Comment'], [\"Investing.com - Comcast (NASDAQ: ) reported on Thursday first quarter   that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that fell short of expectations.

May is often marked by sell-offs, and on the month\\'s first day, with jitters on the rise as some U.S. states begin easing coronavirus shutdowns, the adage held true.  \"Markets had a very strong April as they looked through the valley of economic weakness to a point when stimulus will reignite economic growth,\" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. \"But it could be a longer and deeper valley than many hoped.\" Indeed, stocks had a remarkable run in April, with the S&P 500 and the Dow both posting their strongest monthly percentage gains in 33 years.  Trump said his administration was crafting retaliatory measures against China as punishment for the coronavirus outbreak, once again sparking tariff fears that rattled markets through much of the last two years. Trump has blamed China for what he says is \"misinformation\" when the virus emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan and then quickly spread around the world. \"Trump poking China was the last thing markets needed given so much present economic and financial uncertainty,\" Carter added.

Apple's offering illustrates how companies with the best credit ratings are boosting shareholder returns by tapping cheap debt made available through the Fed's backstopping of the credit markets. Apple shares are virtually flat year-to-date, compared with a 12% drop in the S&P 500 Index ( ).  The technology company raised $8.5 billion by selling four different bonds with maturities ranging from three years to 30 years. It sold a $2 billion three-year bond and a five-year $2.25 billion with coupons of 0.75% and 1.125% respectively, the lowest rates the company has paid on bonds with such durations since 2013, according to Refinitiv IFR data.  The coupons on Apple's 10-year and 30-year bonds were also the lowest the company has paid in the past years, according to the Refinitiv data. The funds will go toward general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and dividend payments, Apple said in a regulatory filing. During the six months ended March 28, Apple spent $38.5 billion to repurchase its own stock.  The Fed slashed interest rates to almost zero in March and said it would act as buyer of last resort in the investment-grade corporate bond market, in a bid to help cash-strapped companies access capital markets roiled by the economic fallout from the pandemic.  While the Federal Reserve has yet to buy a single corporate bond, the intervention has fueled record issuance by companies in need of funding, such as   (N: ), Marriott International Inc (O: ) and   (N: ). The policy has also allowed financially strong companies such as Apple, which had just over $40 billion in cash as of the end of March, to reduce its cost of capital to the benefit of shareholders. In the past week, drugmaker Biogen Inc (O: ) and U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc (N: ) have also sold new bonds at low rates, which the companies said were partly to fund share buybacks.

Southwest Airlines Co (N: ) had also pared losses and was last down 6.9% “Investors looking at the (airlines) group, are technicians, traders, people buying distress for fairly quick bounces,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive at investment adviser Horizon Investment Services LLC, which held Southwest shares until a month ago. “Long-term investors are saying ‘Do I want to sit with airline stocks, that may take four to five years for sustained moves upward, or put my money elsewhere,’\" said Carlson. \"They may feel some new opportunities have developed that are better than things they are holding and can rebound more quickly.” The S&P 1500 Airlines index  Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said the worst is yet to come for the sector given that many airlines have cut capacity around 90% for April and May. \"Until we get some clarity and stability from the global airline sector, we think it is hard to gauge how deep and wide this aerospace canyon is going to be,\" Stallard said. Airline executives have warned of a slow recovery even after the virus is contained and have said demand may not recover to 2019 levels for years. Airlines in the United States have seen a near 95% drop in domestic passengers and are now working to reassure customers about the safety of air travel by instituting new cleaning and social distancing procedures. Data from Dealogic showed that globally airlines have about $10 billion in bonds due to expire in 2020 and $4.7 billion in loans. Major airline bonds fell in mid-morning trade according to data from MarketAxess. United Airlines\\' (O: ) 5% February 2024 bond was down 5% in price to trade at 70 cents on the dollar, the second biggest downward movement among U.S. corporate bonds on Monday.

Major U.S. indexes opened lower but moved higher throughout the afternoon to snap two-day losing streaks. Stocks have rebounded sharply since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states trying to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak. On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo outlined a phased reopening of business in the state hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. California Governor Gavin Newsom said that retail businesses in the state may begin reopening as early as this week. “Can you lift restrictions and begin to phase in economic activity and yet keep the number of cases at bay? That is what the market is focused on right now,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE: ) in Newark, New Jersey. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) rose 26.07 points, or 0.11%, to 23,749.76, the S&P 500 ( ) gained 12.03 points, or 0.42%, to 2,842.74 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 105.77 points, or 1.23%, to 8,710.72. Gains in Microsoft (O: ), Apple (O: ) and Amazon (O: ) were the biggest lifts for the S&P 500, following mixed reaction last week to reports from big tech names. Energy ( ) was the best performing S&P 500 sector, rising 3.7%, as oil prices gained. Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc (N: ),   Inc (O: ), Southwest Airlines Co (N: ) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O: ) fell between 5% and 8%, among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 after Berkshire Hathaway dumped stakes in major U.S. airlines. Shares of Berkshire (N: ) itself fell 2.6% and weighed on the S&P 500 after the conglomerate posted a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50 billion. Buffett, whose comments are closely followed by investors, acknowledged at Berkshire\\'s annual meeting on Saturday that the pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments. “His narrative was relatively sober compared to his posture over the years,\" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.  A flare-up in U.S.-China tensions also pressured the market. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was \"a significant amount of evidence\" that the new coronavirus emerged from a Chinese laboratory. An editorial in China\\'s Global Times said he was \"bluffing\". Investors are also digesting a difficult corporate results season. With more than half of S&P 500 companies reporting so far, first-quarter earnings are expected to have fallen 12.5%, according to Refinitiv data. Shares of   Inc (N: ) tumbled 7.8% after the company said the coronavirus crisis will continue to idle U.S. meat plants and slow production as it reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter.  Data on Monday showed new orders for U.S.-made goods suffered a record decline in March and could sink further as disruptions from the coronavirus fracture supply chains and depress exports. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Not many investors. Shares of Uber (N: ) dropped 3.4% on Monday, while smaller rival   (O: ) tumbled almost 9%, ahead of both companies\\' quarterly reports this week. Their stocks have slid 33% and 42%, respectively, since February, more than twice the drop in the S&P 500 ( ). Investors are keen for the companies to outline a path out of the crisis as Americans - who provide the bulk of the companies\\' revenue - consider resuming travel. \"It\\'s clear to us that business is going to be terrible. What we want to hear is, \\'What is their outlook, and are they seeing any indications of a pickup in activity?\\',\" said King Lip, Chief Investment Strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.  Demand for app-based rides has dropped sharply as governments around the world ordered people to stay home to combat the spread of the virus, prompting both companies to withdraw their full-year guidance. Data from analysts and interviews with drivers suggest trip requests in some cities were down by as much as 80% in April.  Unlike Uber, which could recover some lost revenue with its food delivery business, Lyft has been squarely focused on transporting people.  Some analysts expect globally-exposed Uber to be hit harder in the first quarter than Lyft, which only serves the United States and parts of Canada. Lyft, which reports results after the bell on Wednesday, a day ahead of Uber, could therefore serve as an early indicator of the U.S. market.  Uber\\'s quandary is captured in a TV and online ad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e8XLnMiCOE showing a montage of coronavirus lockdown videos accompanied by the tag line: \"Stay home for everyone who can\\'t. Thank you for not riding with Uber.\" Americans tell pollsters their transportation preferences will change as a result of the crisis, although ride-hailing demand in China, the first country suffering an outbreak, has been recovering since the easing of coronavirus lockdowns. In an April survey by the   (NYSE: ) Institute for Business Value among 25,000 U.S. adults, more than half of the respondents said they would use ride-hailing less or stop completely. China\\'s Didi Chuxing, an Uber competitor, has taken additional safety measures, paying for the installation of transparent plastic sheets to separate drivers and passengers in ride-hailing vehicles in Beijing. The company said it was also exploring technology to trace infected people. An Uber spokesman on Monday confirmed a CNN report https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/03/tech/uber-drivers-riders-face-masks/index.html that Uber will require riders and drivers to wear face coverings in the United States and other countries.  Lyft and Uber recommend face coverings and ask riders to sit in the back seat and open windows during rides. They also ask drivers to regularly disinfect their vehicles, and have supplied limited amounts of sanitizers. Uber\\'s advantage could be in food delivery.  \"We need to find out whether Uber\\'s food delivery service is as strong as we think,\" said Jake Dollarhide, Chief Executive of Longbow Asset Management, which owns shares of Uber and Lyft.  The average analyst estimate for Uber\\'s March-quarter revenue has fallen by more than $600 million since early February. Analysts on average expect Uber to report March quarter rose 14% to $3.53 billion, and an adjusted loss of 83 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.  Lyft is expected to report quarterly revenue up 16% to $898 million, and an adjusted loss of 63 cents per shares. Overall for the first quarter, analysts see Uber losing $1.36 billion and Lyft losing $388 million.

Some hard-hit countries, including Italy, as well as a handful of U.S. states are tentatively easing stay-at-home orders this week, raising hopes for a recovery in oil demand. All the major S&P 500 sub-indexes were trading higher, with the energy sector ( ) rising 2.4%, but the index is a big laggard across sectors with a 36.6% decline this year. Healthcare stocks ( ) were also in the spotlight with   Inc (N: ) up 2.8% after it announced a venture with its German partner had started delivering doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccines for human testing in the United States. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O: ) jumped 5.6% as it said its experimental antibody cocktail for COVID-19 may be available for use by the end of summer or fall, as it ramps up efforts to start human trials in June. Market-leading growth stocks such as   (O: ), Amazon.com Inc (O: ) and Apple Inc (O: ) provided the biggest boost for a second day. The S&P 500 ( ) has climbed about 30% from its March lows on the back of unprecedented stimulus measures and signs of a plateau in new COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world. \"We are in the hope mode regarding the rebound that will come once the economies reopen,\" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for   (NASDAQ: ) in Chicago. However, many market experts have warned the rally could be tested amid a risk of another wave of virus infections and with growing evidence of the damage to the economy and corporate America. Data on Tuesday showed the domestic services sector recorded its first contraction in nearly 10-1/2-years, while the Institute for Supply Management\\'s (ISM) non-manufacturing index showed a smaller-than-expected decline. Investors are now bracing for data on the labor market through the week with expectations of another staggering initial jobless claims reading on Wednesday and nonfarm payrolls for the month of April due Friday.  \"It\\'s all about the mood swings and hopes of the economies reopening. But the problem is this could change once we get to see some of the hard numbers, especially the employment report,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

While withdrawing its forecast for two- to three-year sales growth, Domino's said U.S. same-store sales were up 7.1% in late March and much of April, as diners under lockdown ordered home delivery more often.

The small-cap Russell 2000 index ( ) rose 13.7% in April, besting the benchmark S&P 500\\'s ( ) 12.7% gain. Notably, the Russell\\'s rally accelerated at the end of the month, when it notched six straight days with gains of at least 1%, its longest streak of such gains in two decades.  That outperformance is a good sign to some investors, who believe that domestically-focused small cap stocks tend to be more sensitive to economic fluctuations and are among the first areas of the market to reflect both downturns and rebounds. The index took an outsized hit as stocks tumbled earlier in the year amid concerns over how countrywide lockdowns would impact U.S. growth, with the Russell 2000 falling as much as 42% from its highs, compared to a nearly 34% drop for the S&P.  The spotlight on small caps comes as investors digest a bounce that has lifted the S&P 500 more than 28% from its March lows, and U.S. states try to gradually reopen their economies without stoking a resurgence of coronavirus cases.  \"People are believing that at some point in the third quarter we are going to get back to some semblance of what life was prior to all of this,\" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies (NYSE: ) in New York.  Subsiding volatility is another positive sign for small caps, said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivative strategist at BTIG in New York. The spread between the Russell 2000 Volatility index ( ) and the S&P 500 Volatility index ( ) has narrowed after hitting a high in April, though it remains elevated in historical terms, he said.  Small cap stocks have tended to outperform their larger peers six to 12 months after volatility declines from extreme levels, Emanuel said. (Graphic: Spread between Russell VIX and S&P 500 VIX IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxoqrnvx/Pasted%20image%201588704646241.png) Smaller stocks still have some headwinds to battle, as data is likely to remain dismal through the second quarter, potentially putting profits at risk for a number of companies. Wednesday\\'s release of the ADP (NASDAQ: ) National Employment Report, which showed private employers laid off a record 20.236 million workers in April, was a stark reminder of the road ahead. Nearly one-third of companies in the Russell 2000 are unprofitable, and the number is likely to increase as they use cash to stay in business as the economy struggles to regain its footing, according to the   (NYSE: ) Investment Institute. But even as growing optimism over the reopening of the economy has helped stocks surge, not all analysts are convinced the gains will keep coming.  \"We have just gotten into the recession as well as the earnings contraction,\" said Chris Haverland, global asset allocation strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Winston Salem, North Carolina. \"The markets have gotten ahead of themselves given all the negative economic and earnings news that is going to be coming out in the next few months.\"  The upcoming weeks could go a long way to determining whether small caps can extend their gains, as several states such as Georgia, Florida and California begin to reopen their economies. Signs that officials may need to reverse reopenings in the event of a virus resurgence would likely endanger the rally in small caps.  Nearly 135,000 Americans could die from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, by early August, almost double prior projections, as social-distancing measures for curbing the pandemic are increasingly eased, such as those on restaurants and retail stores, health researchers said Monday.  \"From our point of view, that sort of uncertainty is likely to put the brakes on this rally, at least in the near term,\" said BTIG\\'s Emanuel.

Beijing reported exports rose 3.5% in April on a year earlier, completely confounding expectations of a 15.1% fall and outweighing a 14.2% drop in imports. The surprise stoked speculation the Asian giant could recover from its coronavirus lockdown quicker than first thought and support global growth in the process. The news helped some regional markets steady after a shaky start with both Japan\\'s Nikkei ( ) and South Korea ( ) back to flat. MSCI (NYSE: )\\'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ( ) eased 0.4%, led by a 0.3% dip in Chinese blue chips ( ). E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 ( ) fared better with a bounce of 0.5%, while EUROSTOXX 50 futures ( ) and   futures ( ) both firmed 0.2%.  Markets had started cautiously with renewed Sino-U.S. tensions lurking in the background. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be able to report in about a week or two whether China is meeting its obligations under a trade deal, as Washington weighed punitive action against Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The flow of economic data also remained grim, with U.S. private employers laying off 20 million workers in April. Figures due later on Thursday are forecast to show initial jobless claims rose a further 3 million last week, while Friday\\'s payrolls report is expected to see 22 million jobs lost and unemployment hit 16% or higher. On Wall Street, energy and utility sectors were the main losers while demand for techs kept the Nasdaq in the black.  The Dow ( ) had ended down 0.91% and the S&P 500 ( ) 0.70%, while the Nasdaq ( ) added 0.51%. WORLD\\'S BIGGEST BORROWER Bond markets saw one of the largest shifts in a while after the U.S. Treasury said it would borrow an astonishing $2.999 trillion during the June quarter, five times larger than the previous single-quarter record.  It will sell $96 billion next week alone and a surprising amount of that will be at longer tenors, which in turn pushed up long-term yields and steepened the curve. Yields on 30-year bonds ( ) jumped 7 basis points to 1.40%, the largest daily increase since mid-March. That rise gave a lift to the U.S. dollar on most currencies and its index firmed to 100.192 ( ). The euro eased to $1.0800 ( ), hurt in part by a gloomy economic outlook from the European Commission. Indeed, the single currency sank to its lowest against the Japanese yen since late 2016 at 114.40 ( ), and even the dollar touched a seven-week trough at 105.98 yen  \"There\\'s a lot to like about the yen these days,\" said   (DE: )\\'s global head of G10 FX Alan Ruskin.

Financial markets on Thursday began pricing in a negative U.S. interest rate environment for the first time, as investors grappled with the economic consequences of the new coronavirus outbreak. Stocks have staged a sharp rebound since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Thursday erased its 2020 declines and turned positive for the year. Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak. \"People are watching closely to just see how this reopening process works,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services. \"On the margin, you are starting to hear businesses say that things are starting to look better from a depressed level.” Optimism for markets was also fed by news that U.S. and Chinese trade representatives discussed their Phase 1 trade deal, with China saying they agreed to improve the atmosphere for its implementation. In company news, Uber Technologies (N: ) shares rose 6.0% after the company said ride service bookings slowly recovered in recent weeks.

But some see another derailment in the market’s way, as demand for crude from an America reopening from seven weeks of lockdown isn’t quite enough to support prices near or above $30 a barrel. “What we're seeing right now is the head fake before another surge in CV (crude volume) that pushes storage to maximum capacity & oil prices to new lows,” said a weekend tweet from Art Berman, who has nearly 22,000 followers on Twitter, made up mostly of oil and gas professionals. A petroleum geologist-turned-investment analyst with over 35 years in the business, Berman specializes in the study of comparative crude inventory. In his words, the current rebound is “reminiscent of the March-June 2015 false oil-price rally, before markets accepted that things weren't going back to the way they were before”. Berman lists five oil rallies from mid-2018 to this year that have failed: i. Iran export waivers in Oct 2018; ii. Attacks on ships in the Gulf in April 2019; iii. OPEC+ cuts extension in July 2019; iv. Saudi refinery attack in September 2019; v. OPEC+ extension, China-U.S. trade deal and Qassem Soleimani assasination. “What are the odds for Rally #6?” he asks, predicting that U.S. crude’s potential run to mid $30 levels will be “followed by sub-$20”. This isn’t to say that crude prices won’t experience another surge after the death of the current rally. The sheer collapse in U.S. oil rigs and anticipated well shut-ins mean the greatest mismatch in supply/demand will probably be behind us at some point, as Morgan Stanley suggests. But that’s for the future. The oil market’s problem, however, is the “now”. Supply builds are still too large compared to the trajectory of production losses, and that will eventually max out storage capacity. And that will kill the present rally before too long. Rigs actively drilling for oil have fallen to lows not seen since the financial crisis, reaching 292 this week - a precipitous 57% drop from the 683 reading eight weeks ago. The trajectory of well shut-ins suggests that tight oil production may fall below 3 million barrels per day by June. Yet,   have averaged 12.8 million barrels per week over the past six weeks - about four times above the norm for this time of year. While builds have slowed in Cushing, Oklahoma - the delivery point for expiring U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude contracts - the hub itself is just about 11 million barrels to hitting capacity. And most of the space in Cushing has been leased out already, according to those in the know. The Trump administration is trying to push more U.S. crude into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, where there’s still space in the underground salt caverns. But in the meantime, a lot more foreign oil is waiting to come into the United States. Some 28 tankers with Saudi oil, including 14 VLCCs carrying a total of 43 million barrels,  on the U.S. Gulf and West coasts in stages. The Saudi flotilla will join dozens more tankers waiting to unload in US ports. Thirty-four tankers are off the U.S. West Coast, laden with about 25 million barrels of crude. Another 31, carrying a similar load, are waiting to unload at the Gulf Coast. The Trump administration is under pressure to slap tariffs or take other punitive action on the incoming Saudi oil to prevent them from adding to the U.S. glut. But that will be difficult considering the Saudis have already started “playing ball” with Donald Trump - by agreeing first to the new round of production cuts, then raising their official selling prices to Asia in a bid to get the broader market price of oil up (the strategy worked, adding to this week’s gains). All this indicates that the timer has started on oil’s rally. On the precious metals side, gold is likely to continue pitching for $1,750 - and falling short. Even the worst U.S. jobs numbers in history couldn’t result in much of a safe-haven bid for gold for the just-ended week. “Gold is continuing to hover around $1,700 as it continues to search for direction,” said Craig Erlam, strategist at New York-based OANDA. “It's been consolidating for much of the last month and today's price action doesn't suggest anything is going to change just yet.” Gold lost out to stocks as the well closed amid optimism that the world’s largest economy will recover from the unprecedented blow dealt by the coronavirus. Crude prices ended with a second week of double-digit gains after the U.S.   hit financial crisis lows. , the benchmark for U.S. crude, settled Friday’s trade up $1.19, or 5%, at $24.74 per barrel. For the week, WTI was up 25%, pushing through with the previous week’s near 17% gain as traders and investors bet on slumping oil production and nascent recovery in demand from a reopening of the U.S. economy from Covid-19 lockdowns. “WTI is still the cheapest barrel to run in North America and tells me it should continue to perform,” said Scott Shelton, energy futures broker at ICAP (LON: ) in Durham, N.C. London-traded  , the global benchmark for oil, finished Friday’s session up $1.51, or 5%, at $30.97. For the week, Brent was up nearly 17%, after last week’s gain of more than 23%. U.S. oil rigs, as measured by oil services firm Baker Hughes, fell by 33 this week to reach 292. The number had previously never fallen beneath 300, since the 2008/09 financial crisis. The record low for U.S. oil rigs was 98, seen in November 2002. But a combination of oil and gas rigs, known as the total rig count, hit a record low of 374, after falling by 34 this week, according to Baker Hughes, which has been tracking those numbers since 1940. Private Genscape data on Cushing oil inventory estimates  weekly report on oil stockpiles. EIA weekly report on  EIA   weekly rig count. The Labor Department said another 3.17 million Americans lost their jobs for the week to May 2, bringing to more 33 million the number who have been laid off since the pandemic struck the United States in a big way.

Despite the drop on the day, June futures for gold were up on the week, rising 0.4%. , which tracks real-time trades in bullion, fell $10.75, or 0.6%, to $1,705.84 Support pledged by Chinese trade negotiators for the phase-one of their trade deal with the U.S. also bolstered sentiment on Wall Street. Friday’s reach out by trade officials in Beijing to their counterparts in Washington was the first since the deal was ratified in January. It also comes after blame heaped by the Trump administration on China lately for allegedly creating the coronavirus in a lab and spreading it to the world. White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow, speaking on Fox Business, said he wasn’t sure if the Q2 U.S. jobs picture “is as bad as it gets”. “I don’t think this pandemic contraction has yet fully run,” Kudlow said. The consumer-driven US economy shrank 4.8% in the first quarter. While that was already the sharpest decline in a quarter since the 2008/09 financial crisis, economists predict that the current quarter would be worse, as the now mostly-reopened economy was unlikely to show much recovery until the July-September stretch. *   Barani Krishnan does not own or hold a position in the commodities or securities he writes about.

Trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus to dampen the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. economy and financial markets have sent stocks soaring off their lows, while the worst of the fallout on growth and employment has yet to be felt.  The following graphics illustrate the disconnect that has developed between the stock market and the reeling U.S. economy.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell issued his sober review of an economy slammed by a record pace of job losses and bracing for worse ahead as most U.S. states moved toward reopening after weeks of shutdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus. The pandemic has killed more than 82,000 people in the United States so far, and many epidemiological models now point to a death toll that will surpass 100,000 in a matter of weeks.  Powell pointed to uncertainty over how well future outbreaks of the virus can be controlled and how quickly a vaccine or therapy can be developed, and said policymakers needed to be ready address \"a range\" of possible outcomes. \"It will take some time to get back to where we were,\" Powell said in a webcast interview with Adam Posen, the director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"There is a sense, growing sense I think, that the recovery may come more slowly than we would like. But it will come, and that may mean that it\\'s necessary for us to do more.\" For a central banker who spent part of his career as a deficit hawk and has tried to avoid giving advice to elected officials, the remarks marked an extraordinary nod to the risks the U.S. economy is facing from the combined health and economic crisis brought on by the pandemic. The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and set up a broad network of programs to ensure financial markets continue to function during the pandemic. It has also established precedent-setting lending facilities for companies and the first-ever corporate bond purchases. Congress, for its part, has allocated nearly $3 trillion for economic relief during the crisis. The U.S. response to date \"has been particularly swift and forceful,\" Powell said. But the longer those health risks persist, he said, the more likely businesses will fail and households will be strapped for income in a downturn that he noted has fallen most heavily on those least able to cope. A recent Fed survey, Powell said, estimated that 40% of households with less than $40,000 in income included someone who has lost a job since February. The worst-case outcome leaves the economy mired in \"an extended period of low productivity growth and stagnant incomes ... Additional fiscal support could be costly but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery,\" Powell said in what amounted to a direct call for Congress to ramp up its aid during the crisis. \"This trade-off is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending,\" he said. NEGATIVE RATES The Fed, for its part, will continue to \"use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way,\" Powell said. But those tools, he made clear, don\\'t include pushing interest rates below zero, as some other central banks did fighting the global financial crisis more than a decade ago. Negative interest rates, he said, are \"not something that we are considering.\"  Major U.S. stock indexes were sharply lower in midday trading, with the benchmark S&P 500 index ( ) down about 1.6%. Yields on Treasury securities fell, and some contracts in interest rate futures markets continued to price in a small chance the Fed might resort to a negative-rates policy within the year. The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are deliberating further responses to the pandemic. White House officials have said they want to assess how an initial round of economic reopenings by states goes before deciding what to do. An increasing number of U.S. governors have lifted restrictions, moves that in other countries have preceded new outbreaks and increases in cases, and that epidemiologists here https://reichlab.io/covid19-forecast-hub fear will do the same.  But with the U.S. economy having lost a staggering 20.5 million jobs in April alone and some 33 million Americans applying for jobless benefits since late March, many state and local leaders have begun to see the economic risks of continued lockdowns as too high. In a Senate hearing on Tuesday, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, spoke of the risk the country could \"paradoxically\" end up worse off if it reopens too haphazardly and ends up with not just new rounds of infections, but a second wave of restrictions on who can go to work and what businesses can stay open.

Add a Comment'], ['By Sinéad Carew New York (Reuters) - Wall Street\\'s three major indexes closed lower for the second day in a row after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday of extended economic weakness due to the coronavirus pandemic and called for Congress to agree on additional fiscal support. While the indexes closed above their session lows as they pared losses in the final minutes of the day, investors appeared to price in a deeper economic downturn than they had previously expected, fearing Powell\\'s call for additional stimulus would go unanswered.  While Powell pledged in a webcast to use the U.S. central bank\\'s power as needed, he suggested that it might not be enough to avoid deep economic damage without more fiscal support. \"He\\'s saying if you want to avoid a slow recovery and long-term economic damage you need a strong fiscal response, effectively placing that responsibility back over to governments instead of central banks,\" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ: ) in Jersey City, New Jersey. And divisions among Republicans and Democrats appear to have dimmed the prospects for additional fiscal support from Congress, according to Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at   (NYSE: ).  Market participants said they were relieved by Powell\\'s indication that the Fed would not push interest rates below zero but some seemed taken aback by his downbeat view on the economy.  Schwab\\'s Kleintop said Powell\\'s tone was more pessimistic than in the recent past. \"The market took away that maybe there\\'s more bad news out there than they\\'d been pricing in,\" he said.  Powell\\'s comments followed a sharp selloff in equities on Tuesday after a warning from leading U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci that the virus was not yet under control. Fauci\\'s comments prompted concerns about how the economy would emerge from weeks of virus-related lockdowns. The depth of Wednesday\\'s decline was due to the combination of Fauci\\'s comments and Powell\\'s warning, TD Ameritrade\\'s Cruz said: \"The biggest implication is that some of the economic activity we\\'ve lost may never be recovered.\" Another negative factor was a decision by an independent board overseeing billions in federal retirement dollars that it would indefinitely delay plans to invest in some Chinese companies. \"It adds to the tension ahead of an announcement Trump said could come this week on the Phase One (U.S.-China) trade deal,\" said Schwab\\'s Kleintop.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) fell 516.81 points, or 2.17%, to 23,247.97, the S&P 500 ( ) lost 50.12 points, or 1.75%, to 2,820 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) dropped 139.38 points, or 1.55%, to 8,863.17. Investor bets on a swift recovery had helped the three main U.S. stock indexes climb about 30% from their March lows.  But as officials around the world and in parts of the United States began easing lockdown rules with a view to restarting local economies, fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections have diminished those hopes.

Add a Comment'], ['By Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - A lightning-quick rally in U.S. equities is showing cracks, as investors face mounting evidence that the economy\\'s coronavirus-fueled woes may be far longer-lasting than many had anticipated.  For weeks, hopes that massive stimulus from the Federal Reserve and U.S. government would set the stage for a recovery later in the year fueled a blistering rebound in stocks even as the worst drop-off in jobs since the Great Depression slammed the economy. But recent comments from top officials have undercut the case for a speedy economic recovery even as states ease lockdown restrictions, forcing investors to factor in a protracted downturn that would likely weigh on stocks while fueling flows to bonds and other safe-haven assets.  After surging over 30% in just over a month, the S&P 500 ( ) benchmark stock index has edged down about 4% since late April. Equity-focused funds have seen three straight weeks of outflows totaling around $30 billion, analysts at   (DE: ) said in a report. In contrast, bond funds have notched inflows for four consecutive weeks, drawing nearly $47 billion, the bank said.  \"There’s still a lot of uncertainty out there,\" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist with Edward Jones. \"There’s corporate earnings uncertainty, there’s economic uncertainty, and then there’s just the behavioral adjustment of consumers ... facing down a health risk and trying to restart their lives.” Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday of an “extended period” of weak economic growth, citing concerns over how well future outbreaks of the virus can be controlled and how quickly a vaccine or therapy can be developed. Those comments came a day after the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told Congress that U.S. states lifting sweeping lockdowns could touch off new outbreaks of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 80,000 Americans. In addition, there are renewed tensions between the United States and China, a reminder of the trade tensions between the world\\'s two largest economies that rattled stocks throughout 2019, and some predictions of deflationary pressures on prices. “Skepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,” analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) said in a recent note to clients. “A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but concerns exist that we believe ... investors are dismissing.”  Concerns include $103 billion in expected bank loan losses over the next four quarters, a lack of stock buybacks and domestic and global political uncertainty, the bank said.  Several big-name investors have warned in recent days about the rally in equities becoming overextended. David Tepper of hedge fund Appaloosa Management told CNBC on Wednesday that the current market was the second most overvalued he has ever seen. Famed hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller told the Economic Club of New York https://twitter.com/EconClubNY/status/1260302609824522240?s=20 on Tuesday that the risk-reward https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/risk-reward-for-stocks-is-maybe-as-bad-as-ive-seen-it-stanley-druckenmiller-says.html in today’s market was \"maybe as bad as I\\'ve seen it in my career.\"  The concentration of the market\\'s gains in a small group of technology and internet stocks, obscuring the underperformance of other areas, is also sending a cautionary note.  The average stock in the S&P 500 is down 8.7% since April 29, more than double the index\\'s losses since that date, according to an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group. An extended resurgence of stock market volatility could accelerate flows into fixed-income assets, which have recently drawn investors seeking to benefit from the Fed’s expanded bond-buying program.  \"The stock market is indicating that we are going to continue to move toward recovery whereas the bond market is just kind of sitting there,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ( ) has stayed in a tight range in recent weeks after falling sharply in late March. Bond yields move inversely to prices. The rally in stocks may have left equities more vulnerable to bad news, including problems that U.S. states may encounter as they move to reopen their economies in coming weeks, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at   (NYSE: ) Investment Institute. “There is probably more downside in equity prices than there is in bond yields,” Samana said. \"The bond market is already fairly cautious in its positioning in terms of the view of the world that it has.\" (This story has been refiled to correct typographical error in headline.)

While all three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session solidly higher, they see-sawed for much of the day, with reopening state economies and the possibility of additional stimulus doing battle with revived trade war fears and bleak economic data. \"This market is a battle over time frames,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \"Those pushing the market up believe we\\'re going to get a vaccine in a reasonable amount of time, the economy isn\\'t totally going to fall apart, that unemployment is not going to spike appreciably higher.\"  \"On days when (the market is) pushed down, the naysayers come to the forefront, when it bounces back up the more optimistic investors see an opportunity,\" Ghriskey added. The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the governor\\'s lockdown orders, fueling hopes that mandated restrictions could be lifted sooner rather than later. But an ousted health official testified before a U.S. House of Representatives panel that the United States could face \"the darkest winter\" if its response to the pandemic failed to improve. Comments by Trump late Wednesday blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak and revived trade war fears, even as mandated lockdowns continue to damage the economy.  That damage was in evidence in a report from the U.S. Labor Department, which showed just under 3 million new jobless claims last week, pushing the seven-week tally well over 36 million. A White House spokeswoman said Trump is open to another possible stimulus bill, but will not sign the bill put forward by House of Representatives Democrats. \"One of the major parts of the House bill is support for state and local governments and that\\'s critical for state institutions that are really hurt by this pandemic,\" Ghriskey added.

Canadian investors sold C$29.3 billion in U.S shares, by far the largest since data have been compiled, Statscan said, noting investors also sold off C$11.5 billion in foreign bonds in March, with nearly half in U.S. Treasury bonds. The previous record for Canadian sales of foreign securities was C$15.5 billion in January 2016. Global stock and capital markets began to show higher volatility in late February, the agency said, as the global COVID-19 crisis intensified. That volatility, which in Canada was marked by the start of a severe decline in stock prices and government bond yields in the last few days of February, extended to March, Statscan said, as officials shuttered non-essential businesses and urged people to stay home to slow the spread of the virus. The S&P 500 ( ) plunged to its lowest in more than three years in March, down as much as 35.4% from a record high in the previous month. Meanwhile, foreign investors also reduced their exposure to Canadian securities in March by C$9.8 billion, largely on sales of shares.

The need to restart production lines and reopen offices idled by the coronavirus pandemic mean issues such as sick pay and working conditions are suddenly a top priority for the C-suite and, for some investors, a golden opportunity to apply the principles of ethical investing. Buying into companies based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors was growing in popularity before the virus started spreading. But the focus was largely on how companies were dealing with climate change and overly generous executive pay – the E and G – rather than social issues such as the well-being of staff. The virus is driving a reassessment. \"Someone the other day said \\'has environment taken a back seat? And my reply was \\'no, it\\'s more the \\'S\\' has climbed into the front seat\\',\" John Goldstein, head of the Sustainable Finance Group at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), told a media conference call in April. Investors initially baulked when Amazon (NASDAQ: ) founder Jeff Bezos said last month that he expected to spend $4 billion on virus-related expenses including protecting staff. The online retailer needs to convince employees, unions and governments that it can keep workers safe or risk warehouse closures at a time of unprecedented demand from shoppers. Amazon shares plunged over 7% when Bezos announced the outlay would wipe out its next quarterly profit but have since pared much of those losses and are up 28% since the start of this year.  Portfolio manager Lewis Grant at Federated Hermes (NYSE: ) said the move would help Amazon improve \"its ability to deliver in the long-term\".  \"For the cynics, it is also a smart PR move,\" he added. Companies which have chosen to cut jobs rather than investor payouts have drawn criticism and, taking note of the mood and welter of government supports on offer, many have taken steps to ease the financial impact on staff from the crisis. Around 400 companies have launched initiatives ranging from paid leave for casual companies to halting redundancies, according to a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch report in late April. Corey Klemmer, director of engagement for Domini Impact Investments in New York, helped organise an investor letter in late March calling on companies to prioritise workers\\' welfare amid the pandemic, both for humanitarian concerns and also \"the systemic risk it poses to our portfolios\".  The letter now has 322 signatories from managers overseeing some $9.2 trillion in assets - nearly double the assets at the time the letter was first released on March 26. A Reuters analysis of British regulatory filings between March 23 and April 29 showed of the 98 companies to announce they had furloughed workers because of the virus, 76 had also cut executive pay in some form, despite there being no legal obligation to do so. Companies which are seen to be \\'doing good\\' do get rewarded. Europe\\'s sustainable fund universe pulled in 30 billion euros in the first quarter of 2020 compared with an outflow of 148 billion euros for the overall European fund sector, according to research by Morningstar. Issuance of so-called \"social bonds\", used to raise money for projects with positive social outcomes such as boosting community health, meanwhile, hit consecutive record highs in March and April, Refinitiv data showed. A TEMPORARY TREND? Often viewed as a cost centre to cull, the emphasis on staff as a stakeholder to shield, is a departure for Wall Street and may well be a temporary feature of the coronavirus pandemic. \"It is too early to know how the\\xa0pandemic will affect the\\xa0balance between corporate social\\xa0responsibility and pursuit of shareholder value above all else,\" said Beth Allen, spokeswoman for the Communications Workers of America. Recent research from Boston Consulting found 52% of investors in a U.S. survey disagreed or strongly disagreed with the view that it was important for healthy companies to \"fully pursue their ESG agenda and priorities as they navigate the crisis, even if it means guiding to lower EPS or delivering below consensus\". Indeed, the longer it takes economies to recover from the pandemic, the greater the pressure on companies to cut costs, including jobs. Thousands of jobs have already been lost in the aviation and airline sectors as the virus forces companies to ground flights and slash schedules. But whatever the nature of the recovery, funds that follow ESG strategies say companies that do right by the community perform better.

U.S. consumer confidence data will show whether Americans believe the economy has bottomed, while the pound is rallying despite the U.K. being engulfed in a storm over a government official's violation of lockdown rules that he helped draft. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, May 26th. There’s a broad risk-on move in global markets as institutional investors scramble to react to signs that the worst of the coronavirus has passed in the U.S. and Europe. Treasury bonds,   and other havens – notably the   – are all down, while industrial commodities, emerging market currencies and equities are almost all higher. Over the weekend, Japan lifted its national state of emergency, while Spain announced its tourism sector – one of Europe’s largest – would reopen from July. German press reports suggest the country will drop its travel warning from next month, after already agreeing in principle with its neighbors over a reopening of borders for non-essential travel. The pound strengthened as expectations grew that the government will be forced into lifting lockdown measures, amid public outrage at a senior government advisor who flouted the rules that he himself had argued for. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused to fire his senior aide Dominic Cummings, the architect of the successful Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, who drove over 250 miles while both he and his wife were ill with the coronavirus, defying government instructions banning non-essential travel. Separately, the Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday that some 47,000 people had died of the virus, nearing the 50,000 that was the government’s worst-case estimate in April.  rose by 1.1% against the dollar and by 0.5% against the  , helped also by reports that the EU was softening its position in the ongoing talks over post-Brexit trading relations. \\xa0 U.S. stocks are set to open with a bang on Tuesday, caught in a wave of optimism over economic reopenings in the U.S. and Europe.

The market will get a reality check at 10 AM ET with the publication of the Conference Board’s   for May. \\xa0Confidence plunged to a record low in April as tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs in response to lockdown orders across the country.

The UN-backed body warned on Monday that a second wave of the virus is more than possible if discipline on social distancing is relaxed too soon. “We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now that it's going to keep going down,” WHO executive director Mike Ryan said. The comments come after a Memorial Day weekend which generated scenes of crowded beaches at popular U.S. holiday spots, where few holidaymakers appeared to be wearing masks. Oil prices gained but struggled to make new post-Covid highs even as equities and metals marched higher. By 6:30,   futures were at $34.08 a barrel, up 2.5% on the day, while   futures were up 1.4% at $36.04. Reports earlier suggested that Russia’s government is meeting with national oil companies later to coordinate an extension of the supply cuts agreed last month with OPEC and other major exporters. The cuts have been one element of a sharp rebalancing of the oil market in the last two weeks, along with recovering fuel demand. Data on the U.S. market from the American Petroleum Institute will only be published on Wednesday due to the Memorial Day holiday.

American shares are as much as 16% overvalued at present levels, and a short position on the   Index looks increasingly favorable, said strategist Daniel Grosvenor. Low bond yields aren’t sufficient to sustain equity valuations after the surge in shares from the March lows, he added. “The threat of renewed tariffs adds clear downside risks to already-depressed global trade, and this could derail the eventual earnings recovery,” Grosvenor wrote in a report. “The market is vulnerable to a correction.” Despite a slew of warnings about valuations and the pace of the rebound following the huge sell-off earlier this year, as well as the racheting-up of hostilities between the U.S. and China in the past couple of weeks, investors are pushing stock prices up through some key technical levels. The S&P 500 rose to nearly 3,069 intraday on Thursday, its highest level since March 5, and now sits above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages. “The S&P 500 is expensive versus history on almost all the measures we consider,” Grosvenor said.

The oil industry is also in focus with OPEC potentially meeting early to discuss further output cuts. And there's the May U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI data to study. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, 1st June. What started as a peaceful demonstration against police killings of black people after the death of George Floyd as he was restrained by Minneapolis police officers has turned into violent protests that have ravaged cities from Philadelphia to Los Angeles and flared near the White House. Pressure is mounting on President Donald Trump, as he faces accusations of inciting racial violence as he appeared to call on his supporters to counter-protest outside the White House. He has also said the U.S. will designate the far-left Antifa group a 'terrorist organisation'. The turmoil was a fresh setback for the economy which was only just emerging from a downturn akin to the Great Depression. Following poor data on spending and trade out on Friday, the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated economic output could drop a staggering 51% annualised in the second quarter. Financial markets tuned in nervously to President Trump’s response Friday to China’s decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong. In the end, the president said he would strip Hong Kong of its special status with the U.S., but didn’t renounce the recently signed trade deal with China, as the market had feared. Still, relations between the two economic superpowers are particularly tense, and such a move can’t be ruled out in the future, especially as the U.S. presidential election draws nearer. Bloomberg reported Monday that Chinese government officials have told major state-run agricultural firms to pause purchases of some American farm goods, including soybeans, as Beijing looks to evaluate the recent escalation in tensions between the two nations. “If Trump wants to increase his chances of beating Biden in November, then he needs to turn even tougher than China than he currently is,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. U.S. stock markets are set to open a little lower, after posting a positive month in May. Continuing disturbances throughout the country on top of heightened tensions with China will likely weigh on the market ahead of the release of ISM manufacturing PMI data.\\xa0 By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the   contract was down 26 points or 0.1%, while the   contract was down 0.2% and the   contract was down 0.4%. Still, on a more positive note, Goldman Sachs has abandoned its call for another steep sell-off. The investment bank has rolled back its prediction that the   would slump to the 2,400 level -- over 20% below Friday’s 3,044 close -- and now see downside risks capped at 2,750. The U.S. equity benchmark could even rally further to 3,200. “The powerful rebound means our previous three-month target of 2,400 is unlikely to be realized,” the strategists wrote. “Monetary and fiscal policy support limit likely downside to roughly 10%. Investor positioning has oscillated between neutral and low and is a possible 5% upside catalyst.” In Asia, the benchmark   index gained 0.8%. In Europe, with Germany closed for a June 1 public holiday, the   in London and the   in Paris both rose 1%. This week will see little of Federal Reserve officials as they are now in the traditional blackout period ahead of their next policy meeting later this month, but there will be plenty of economic data to study. Friday sees the important   release, but ahead of that comes   for May, at 10 AM ET.\\xa0 This is expected to show an improvement in sentiment in the manufacturing sector, with the index expected to climb to 43.0 from 41.5 in April, as parts of the U.S. economy started to emerge from the lockdown. However, an improvement isn’t a given. Nordea said, in a research note, that it wouldn’t be a surprise to see an even weaker reading in May, citing a disappointing Weekly Economic Index release from the New York Fed as well as the April index having not dropped as much as had been expected. The news from Europe wasn't particularly encouraging, as although manufacturers in the euro zone appear to have passed their nadir, activity is still contracting sharply. ? Oil prices have been on the tear of late, with the front-month   and   contracts posting their strongest monthly gains in years in May as crude production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, dropped to its lowest level in two decades. To solidify this change in sentiment, Algeria, which currently holds the OPEC presidency, has proposed that an OPEC+ meeting planned for June 9-10 be brought forward to this Thursday. One of the topics of discussion will likely be an extension of the current cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day for between one to two months. Under the current deal, the group is scheduled to reduce the scale of cuts to 7.7 million barrels a day from July.\\xa0 “A shorter period may make an extension more palatable to the Russians, who were not keen to extend current cuts through until the end of this year, which was reportedly suggested by other members of the deal,” said ING, in a research note to clients. \\xa0 \\xa0 Add a Comment\"], ['By Joshua Franklin NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. public companies sold more than $60 billion in shares in May, the biggest monthly haul ever, as they capitalized on a stock market rally fueled by hopes that the COVID-19 pandemic is subsiding.

Convertible bonds, typically popular in tech and healthcare, saw the likes of Southwest Airlines (N: ) and cruise line Carnival (N: ) come to market with the second and third biggest deals of the year, according to Dealogic data. This wave of issuance has been met with increased demand from traditional debt and equity investors with less experience in the market, on top of typical inflows, convertible bond specialists said.  \"We have seen a pickup in demand from non-traditional convert investors,\" said Michael Youngworth, head of convertible bond strategy at Bank of America. \"I\\'ve received lots of calls from either traditional credit investors or some traditional equity investors who are looking to get into converts now.\" The unique structure of the debt allows investors to bet that the price of the stock will rise significantly, usually within five years. That has attracted investors looking to position themselves for an eventual economic recovery. \"To the extent there is a downturn again, you\\'re safer being in the convertible tranche than the equity tranche,\" said Santosh Sreenivasan, head of equity-linked capital markets for the Americas at JPMorgan (NYSE: ). About $20.7 billion in new U.S. convertible debt was issued in May, according to Bank of America, the highest monthly volume on record. The previous high was $19.2 billion in May 2001.  Beyond its appeal as a recovery trade, investors have been drawn to the market\\'s valuations and return. The price of the iShares Convertible Bond ETF (Z: ) is up 6.49% this year, while the S&P 500 index ( ) has fallen 5.24%. The convert market has also been a refuge for equity investors, said Joe Wysocki, who manages the long-only convertible fund at Calamos Investments.  \"You\\'re seeing companies cut dividends. As an equity investor, convertibles allow you to stay invested, to keep the equity upside,\" said Wysocki. Convertible debt is a hybrid security, offering a regular fixed payout like a bond, while giving bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity if shares rise over a certain price.  While the possibility of an equity payout is drawing new investors in, bankers selling issuers on this structure are highlighting the slim chances of a conversion, according to banking sources who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Banks began pitching convertible deals early the pandemic, after plummeting stock values ground equity issuance to a halt. Since then the product has become the biggest source of fee growth for equity bankers, according to Refinitiv data. Convertibles have made up 34% of U.S. equity deals so far this year, up from 19% last year. The deals were seen as a solution for companies who needed cash but did not want to sell shares at lower valuations, bank sources said.  The ability to issue debt in a zero interest rate environment, and the slim chance the debt would be converted into equity was attractive to companies, those bankers said. Convertible deals are typically structured so the stock would need to rise 75% to 100% before investors could convert, a bank source said. Desperation for cash, however, has led issuers to make some concessions. Conversion premiums - the amount the conversion price exceeds the current share price - have been falling, according to Wysocki. \"That\\'s good for investors like ourselves because you\\'re paying less of a premium so the chances of that getting in the money are higher,\" Wysocki said.

The ratio has since risen to 0.81 but still looks like a bargain to money managers versus the historic average of 1.22. \"A lot of the negativity is reflected in current valuations, which is why there\\'s a lot of upside compared with other industries\" said Ryan Lentell, portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. Cronin at Aberdeen Standard is still watching the direction of credit costs, which will depend on whether there is a second wave of coronavirus cases and more lockdowns. \"Until we get some clarity on the stress tests and credit, it\\'ll be a lot harder to move materially higher in the near term,\" said Cronin. U.S. fiscal stimulus and Federal Reserve support, including interest rate cuts, appear to have put a \"backstop\" behind bank balance sheets, according to Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  Banks have also been boosted by a rotation into value stocks with the S&P 500 Value index ( ) gaining more than 11% since mid-May, compared with an almost 7% gain for the S&P 500 value index ( ).  But Cannon questions how sustainable the rotation will be. And since bank profits depend partly on higher interest rates, Cannon sees a limit to gains in the sector.  \"Interest rates will remain low for a very long time. It\\'s very difficult to see banks regain their pre-crisis levels until there\\'s some sign interest rates will increase,\" he said.

The S&P 500’s staggering rally from its March low has mostly been powered by a sentiment shift overnight, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A trader who bought the SPDR S&P 500 ETF at the Wall Street close and sold at the next open would have made 23% since the trough compared with 13% for holding the same ETF only during normal trading hours, the data show. In fact, the after-hours trade looks like it led the U.S. stock rebound. Overnight sentiment bottomed two days before the  , and outperformance measured from that date was even more extreme. “It reflects the optimism in the U.S. stock market from investors in Asia, as the Fed gave the green light to own U.S. assets,” said Dave Lutz, a managing director at JonesTrading who was referring to the central bank’s emergency measures. The return to form for the trade, which historically outperforms but was derailed in the coronavirus turmoil, adds another layer of mystery to the market’s current defiance of gravity. The S&P 500 is up by more than a third since March even as the pandemic batters the economy and large-scale protests sweep America. The trade may look like easy money, but it also means holding a position that could swing wildly amid an unpredictable news flow.

Investors will be looking for clues on whether the ECB plans to ease monetary policy even further. The ECB padded its emergency bond-buying fund by another 600 billion euros ($680 billion) at its meeting last Thursday, and it’s easy to see why given the depth of the region’s slowdown illustrated by the almost 18% slump in Germany’s industrial production data in April.

Such a deal would result in the biggest healthcare merger to date, creating a partnership worth around 200 billion pounds ($250 billion). The two companies are among a host of firms racing to develop a vaccine for Covid-19, while Gilead’s antiviral drug Remdesivir is seen as a leading treatment for patients suffering from the effects of the virus. Both companies have declined to comment on the report, but doubts exist as to the likelihood of this tie-up now as AstraZeneca’s valuation could soar given its collaboration with researchers at Oxford University put it at the forefront of the search for a vaccine. Crude oil prices pushed higher Monday after a group of major producers agreed to extend a deal on record output cuts to the end of July. Sentiment in the oil market has changed sharply since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia - collectively known as OPEC+ - agreed in April to cut supply by 9.7 million barrels per day during May-June to prop up prices that collapsed due to the coronavirus crisis. On Saturday, the group agreed to extend the deal by a third month to the end of July.\\xa0 The extension had been delayed by the worries of some of the bigger producers, namely Saudi Arabia and Russia, that other countries were playing fast and loose with compliance. Iraq and Nigeria exceeded production quotas in May and June, but they have agreed to slightly deeper cuts to compensate for their failure to the original agreement. Investor sentiment also got a boost from Sunday’s Chinese customs data which indicated that the country’s crude imports soared to 11.34 barrels a day, 15% more than April, a positive indication of China’s recovery from the Covid-19 virus.

Concerns over election-fueled volatility have regained prominence in recent weeks, even as broader market swings have subsided and stocks have surged. Futures on the Cboe Volatility Index ( ), known as Wall Street\\'s \"fear gauge,\" show a visible bump in volatility expectations near the election. Election-related risk captured in VIX futures has risen to about three times the levels seen ahead of the 2012 and 2016 elections based on the spread between September and October futures, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. VIX futures reflect volatility expectations for the month-long period after their expiration. (GRAPHIC: As coronavirus risk recedes, election risk rises - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/qmypmoqmbpr/eikon.png)  Contributing to investors\\' election concerns are polls showing that Trump\\'s standing among voters has eroded amid criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as the protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in police custody.  A Democratic victory could threaten policies championed by Trump and generally favored by Wall Street, including lower corporate tax rates and fewer regulations, analysts said.  \"A potential victory by Joe Biden ... and to a greater extent, a \\'Democratic sweep,\\' are generally considered more market-unfriendly outcomes,\" analysts at BofA Global Research said in a recent note to clients. A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted June 8-9 showed that Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee, led Trump, a Republican, by 8 percentage points among registered voters. The poll also found that 39% of the American public approves of the president\\'s performance in office, while 57% disapproves. In a separate poll last week, more than 55% of Americans said they disapproved of Trump\\'s handling of the protests.  The closely-watched betting site PredictIt put Biden 9 points ahead of Trump, compared with a 6-point lead for Trump a month ago. \"I don\\'t believe we\\'ll get to the election without a substantial spike in volatility,\" said James McDonald, chief executive of hedge fund Hercules Investments.  McDonald expects election-related trades to ramp up in the weeks just before the Nov. 3 general election and plans to deploy options and futures strategies that take advantage of volatility spikes once the results come in. The election-related concerns stand in contrast to a recent easing in broader market volatility: the VIX has fallen to its lowest levels since late February, while the S&P 500 ( ) has climbed 44% from its March 23 closing low.  (Graphic: Positioning for U.S. election volatility - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvggyajvq/April%20-%202020%20election%20positioning%20reflected%20in%20VIX%20futures%20curve.png)  Taxes have been one major area of contrast between the two presidential contenders. Biden has criticized Trump\\'s 2017 tax decreases and pledged to reverse some of those cuts, a move that could weigh on companies that benefited from the legislation.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) have estimated that Biden\\'s tax reform, if enacted, would reduce earnings for S&P 500 companies by around $20 a share in 2021, to $150 a share. Netflix Inc (O: ),   (N: ) and Salesforce.com Inc (N: ) are among the companies that have received a bigger than average benefit from the 2017 tax reform, the bank said.  A Trump win, on the other hand, could raise concerns over the continuation of a U.S.-China trade war that has periodically roiled markets over the last several years. Trump has already taken a harsher tone on China in recent weeks, a move some analysts believe is intended to shore up support among the president\\'s voter base. Financial and technology-related stocks have been particularly sensitive in the past to threats of increased regulation and restrictions on trade with China, and those sectors may again grow more volatile as the election approaches, said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

Crude oil is expected to give back some of its recent gains, while the IPO market is set to welcome   in a busy week. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, June 9th. The economic downturn in the U.S. triggered by the social distancing measures adopted to combat the Covid-19 virus has been officially declared a recession, which started in February - bringing to an end the longest period of economic expansion in U.S. history. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the body which acts as the arbiter for determining U.S. business cycles, said late Monday \"the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions.\"\\xa0 The designation has not come as a surprise, after all U.S. gross domestic product fell 4.8% annualized in the first three months of the year and the next quarter is expected to be much worse. At the same time, the unemployment rate rose from a record low of 3.5% in February, hitting 14.7% in April and 13.3% last month. This puts the spotlight on the two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve, concluding Wednesday, for signs of more stimulus ahead. The Covid-19 outbreak may be past its peak. New York City, regarded as the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., started the slow process of reopening for business on Monday.\\xa0 But it’s important not to forget the damage caused, with over seven million having been infected and more than 400,000 dead to date. And there’s also the economic impact. Global economic output is set to contract by 5.2% in 2020 due to the coronavirus, the World Bank said on Monday, in its latest Global Economic Prospects report. Advanced economies are expected to shrink 7.0% in 2020, the report said, while emerging market economies will contract 2.5%, their first since aggregate data became available in 1960. These forecasts predict a deeper slowdown than the estimates released in April by the International Monetary Fund, which predicted a 3.0% global contraction in 2020. U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, with investors set to take profits after Monday’s gains confirmed a bull market in the tech-driven   index.

Crude oil prices have sold off Tuesday, retreating from the three-month highs achieved after a group of major producers agreed to extend a deal on record output cuts to the end of July. And more losses look likely going forward, according to Goldman Sachs. \"This rebound has been fueled by a macro risk-on backdrop and a policy induced Chinese crude import binge, yet fundamentals are turning bearish,\" Goldman said.

In the first economic projections of the pandemic era, U.S. central bank policymakers put into numbers what has been an emerging narrative: that the measures put in place to battle a health crisis will echo through the economy for years to come rather than be quickly reversed as commerce reopens. The projections show the unemployment rate falling to 6.5% at the end of 2021 and 5.5% at the end of 2022 - a full 2 percentage points above where it was at the end of last year, representing millions of lost years of work.  \"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term,\" the Fed said in a policy statement after a two-day meeting. The response: officials see the key overnight interest rate, or federal funds rate, remaining near zero through at least 2022. The decision to leave that rate unchanged on Wednesday was unanimous.  Officials also promised to maintain the Fed\\'s bond purchases at least at the current pace of around $80 billion per month in Treasuries and $40 billion per month in agency and mortgage-backed securities - a sign the central bank is beginning to shape its long-run strategy for the economic recovery. In remarks that acknowledged the nationwide protests against racial inequality that erupted in recent weeks, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was committed to trying to restore jobs and growth to where they were. \"The work of the Fed touches communities and families and businesses across the country ... We are committed to using our full range of tools ... to ensure the recovery will be as robust as possible,\" Powell said in a news briefing via a video link. \"It is a long road. It is going to take some time.\"  That rebound is expected to begin in earnest in 2021, with economic growth forecast at 5%. On a positive note, the Fed did not mark down its long-run estimates of full employment, trend growth and the federal funds rate, a sign officials feel the country may escape permanent damage.  \"Their messaging is we are keeping rates low, but this is going to work, it is going to get us there,\" said Bruce Monrad, chairman and portfolio manager at Northeast Investors Trust in Boston. On Wall Street, which had been near unchanged ahead of the Fed\\'s statement, stock prices were mixed in choppy trading. The benchmark S&P 500 index ( ) was down 0.4% whereas the   was up 0.5% at a record high. Treasury security yields slipped and the dollar fell against the euro ( ) and yen  YEARS-LONG FIGHT The pledge to keep monetary policy loose until the U.S. economy is back on track repeats a promise made early in the central bank\\'s response to the coronavirus pandemic. That response included cutting interest rates to near zero in March and making trillions of dollars in credit available to banks, financial firms, and a wide array of companies.

The stock market is set to weaken as a result, while crude also heads lower amid fears of a supply glut. All this while concerns are growing about a second wave of the Covid-19 virus. At least initial jobless claims are likely to show an improvement in the employment market, admittedly from a low base. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, June 11th.

The Fed stated that the   is expected to contract by 6.5% in 2020, and the unemployment rate for the year is expected to come in at 9.3%. However, it’s the pace of inflation which is likely to be the key driver for future monetary policy, and this was forecast to cool to a rate of 0.8%, down from 1.9% previously.\\xa0 In the press conference, Fed chief Jerome Powell “mentioned a weak inflation pressure, however, he did not sound overly concerned,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note. “We, on the other hand, see deflation risks as high and have been flagging it for a while.” This followed the core Consumer Price Index turning negative Wednesday. It also declined for the third consecutive month, which has never happened before. The Producer Price Index for May is due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), and will no doubt be watched closely. It measures the change in the price of goods sold by manufacturers and is a leading indicator of consumer price inflation.\\xa0 Analysts estimate the PPI will rise 0.1% for the month of May, a reversal of the 1.3% decline the previous month. Fears are starting to grow that the prompt reopening of many states across the U.S. will result in a second wave of infections from the Covid-19 virus, likely causing even more economic damage to a country already in an exceedingly deep recession with millions unemployed.

At the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve released its first pandemic-era economic outlook, after which Chair Jerome Powell warned of a \"long road\" to recovery. Economic data appeared to back up the Fed\\'s dour economic projections, with jobless claims still more than double their peak during the Great Recession and continuing claims at an astoundingly high 20.9 million.

Some investors said they believed such a pullback was long overdue given expectations for a slow recovery, which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reinforced in remarks on Wednesday. \"We\\'ve been cautious on equities for a while now,\" said Anwiti Bahuguna, head of multi-asset strategy and senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. \"By no means is the virus threat over, on top of the fact that we are not going to recover quickly.\" Indeed, despite a sharp run-up in stocks over the past few weeks, expectations for volatility had remained elevated. The VIX rose on Monday even as the S&P 500 gained 1.2% and momentarily erased its year-to-date losses.

That was the warning from Bloomberg Intelligence’s Gina Martin Adams 48 hours ago, just as the   Index embarked on what seems likely to be a three-day decline, the longest losing streak since early March. In her view, investors were too optimistic and sentiment was running hot, a recipe for a pullback. “The strong surge since March lows has finally resulted in an overheated momentum signal, and combined with extremely bullish options positioning, suggests stocks are likely to go through some short-term consolidation,” the chief equity strategist wrote Tuesday. Hints the stock market was looking stretched were abundant. Martin Adams pointed to the S&P 500’s 14-day relative strength index, or RSI, punching above the critical overbought threshold for the first time since the rally began in March. She also highlighted the Cboe Equity Put/Call Ratio, which measures the relationship between bearish and bullish options, at the lowest level since 2011. On Monday, the S&P 500 capped its fastest 50-day rally since the Great Depression to wipe out all its losses in 2020. At one point, there wasn’t a single stock in the benchmark that was lower since the rebound began. The   surpassed 10,000 for the first time ever, and by Wednesday’s close the index was up 16% this year. During the runup, the fingerprints of retail investors were everywhere -- with frenzied gains in everything from airlines and cruise stocks to companies in bankruptcy and a Chinese real estate firm with a name similar to the popular “Faang” grouping of U.S. tech stocks. Now, after the bets of individual investors looked prescient, they’re experiencing what it’s like to be on the losing side of a trade. A Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) basket of stocks beloved by retail investors -- which includes the likes of   (NYSE: ) Cruises Ltd., United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ: ) Inc. and Boeing (NYSE: ) Co. -- has dropped 13% since Tuesday, the most since just before the market’s bottom in March. The group rose and fell with the S&P 500 in 11 of the past 12 sessions, a stretch of near lock-step moves not seen since December. The pain has been worse in companies that have seen individual investor interest surge in recent weeks. After bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE: ) Inc. rose 577% in the three days through Monday and tens of thousands of users of the Robinhood investing app added the stock to their portfolios, half those gains have been wiped out. In the last three days, the U.S. Global Jets ETF, which has seen its assets surge in recent weeks, is down 20%, the worst stretch since March 20. Over the same time period, American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE: ). and Carnival (NYSE: ) Corp. have all plunged more than 22%. Each rank high on the list of stocks most favored by retail investors. According to website Robintrack, which tracks Robinhood’s data but isn’t affiliated with it, roughly 500,000 or more users of the app hold each of the three stocks. Momentum was running hot across large swaths of the market at the week’s start. At Monday’s close, 224 members in the S&P 500 had their 14-day RSI exceeding 70, the level that indicates a stock or index is overbought. That was the most since 1991. “We felt like a pullback was inevitable because the fundamentals aren’t supporting the levels of return we have seen so far,” said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation strategy for   (NYSE: ) Investment Institute. “It was largely driven by momentum and not driven by the fundamentals.” The S&P 500 fell 3.7% on Thursday as of 11:50 a.m. in New York, bringing its losses over three days to almost 5%. Pockets of the market hit hardest in the original coronavirus crash, including small-caps and cyclical industries, again bore the brunt of the losses. To   Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern (NYSE: ) Mutual Wealth Management, the stock market fell too much on the way down, yet also bounced too quickly on the way up. Somewhere between the two is probably better representative of where we stand, as economies slowly and partially reopen. It “feels like a more accurate depiction of where we’re at right now,” Schutte said. “Future gains are going to be more dependent on how the reopening actually goes.” (Updates prices in 12th paragraph.

In its twice-yearly Monetary Policy Report to U.S. lawmakers, the Fed also set out a litany of risks they see dogging any rebound from the cratering in output caused by widespread shutdowns imposed this spring to contain the spread of COVID-19. \"The strains on household and business balance sheets from the economic and financial shocks since March will likely create persistent fragilities,\" the report said. The central bank delineated a host of other concerns, such as a highly uncertain outlook for containing the outbreak, with a substantial risk for a resurgence in infections; a potential wave of business bankruptcies - among small businesses in particular - arising from the collapse in consumer demand; uncertainty about prospects for a recovery in demand for workers and possible downward pressures on wages; major stresses appearing in state and local government finances; and a potentially costly reconfiguration of global supply chains fractured by the disruption to trade.  Moreover, the COVID-19 recession, determined earlier this week to have officially begun in February, has weighed most heavily on the critical services sector, accounting for roughly two-thirds of U.S. economic output, and that may hamper the recovery. \"Unlike past recessions, services activity has dropped more sharply than manufacturing - with restrictions on movement severely curtailing expenditures on travel, tourism, restaurants, and recreation - and social-distancing requirements and attitudes may further weigh on the recovery in these sectors,\" the report said.  The Fed said the pandemic\\'s hit to the labor market was \"sudden, severe, and widespread\" but pointed out that job losses disproportionately affected low-wage workers who may be less prepared to last an extended period of time without pay.  And it noted that state and local governments are under \"significant stress\" after facing a sharp drop in tax revenue. State and local governments continued to shed jobs in May even as the economy overall gained workers, providing an early sign that the worst of coronavirus-related job losses may be over. LONG ROAD AHEAD  The release of the report, which precedes two days of congressional testimony by Fed Chair Jerome Powell next Tuesday and Wednesday, comes two days after the Fed wrapped up its latest policy meeting.  At the meeting, the Fed signaled the U.S. economy faces an arduous and uncertain recovery from the recession triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. \"It is a long road. It is going to take some time,\" Powell said in a webcast press conference after the meeting. In economic projections on Wednesday, Fed policymakers saw the economy shrinking at a 6.5% annualized rate in 2020 and the unemployment rate at 9.3% at year\\'s end. While officials saw growth snapping back somewhat in 2021, they projected the jobless rate would remain elevated. [nW1N2D901E] That somber assessment of the outlook doused much of the optimism for a fast recovery that had been sown by the surprise growth in employment in May and factored heavily in Thursday\\'s dramatic sell-off on Wall Street, when U.S. stocks fell by the most since March. On Friday, stocks staged an early rally, but by mid-afternoon had given back most of those gains and had recouped only a small fraction of Thursday\\'s 5.9% drop in the S&P 500 Index ( ). Powell and his colleagues have repeatedly reinforced their pledge to use all the tools at their disposal to foster a rebound, and Friday\\'s report reasserted that commitment. Since March, the Fed has slashed its benchmark overnight lending rate to near zero and rolled out nearly a dozen emergency programs to stabilize financial markets and provide credit for firms in need of capital to survive the downturn. According to this week\\'s projections, all 17 current Fed policymakers see the key overnight interest rate, or federal funds rate, remaining near zero through next year, and 15 of 17 see no change through 2022. Perhaps notably the Fed did not use the monetary policy report to call on Congress outright for further fiscal support, though in a separate report issued Friday on a series of community outreach events it noted that extra unemployment benefits expire this summer and \"if the economic downturn continues and the benefits are not renewed\" many families will not have the money for rent, food, or other bills.  On Wednesday Powell kept his admonition mild, noting the difficulty that potentially millions of people will have finding jobs again soon and saying \"it\\'s possible that we will need to do more, and it’s possible that Congress will need to do more.\"      Add a Comment'], ['By Rodrigo Campos and Karin Strohecker NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Argentina\\'s stocks are rocketing, outpacing equity market peers around the world in the second quarter as growing risk appetite has lured investors to the country\\'s listed firms despite biting economic and debt crises. The S&P Merval stock index ( ) plunged near 50% from mid January to mid March. But this quarter, price returns in pesos for the 20-stock index have climbed as much as 100%. When translated to U.S. dollars using the official exchange rate, they are now up 64%, the most among the largest stock markets globally. Investors jumped in even as Argentina\\'s government has scrambled to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt and forecasts called for the economy, mired in recession since 2018, to contract as much as 10% this year. \"There are periods of time where it gets just so cheap that people come rushing and move it to the opposite side for a while,\" said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot (NYSE: ) Wealth Management in Salem, Massachusetts. Lutts recently added to his holdings of Buenos Aires-based e-commerce giant Mercado Libre (O: ) but said he would not broaden his exposure to Argentina partly on concerns over financial markets\\' lack of confidence in the country. Argentina defaulted for the ninth time in May following turmoil sparked last year by the sharp political decline of President Mauricio Macri, seen as a market reformer. Yet his successor, moderate Peronist Alberto Fernandez, is now seemingly closing in on a debt restructuring deal with international creditors, a development credited as one reason behind the latest leg of the stocks rally.  Graphic: Stock price Q2 returns in USD, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopakroqpa/2020-06-11_18h22_34.png Some analysts said tight capital controls have added luster to the rally. Parallel trades of the peso value the currency much more cheaply than the official rate, a gap which has widened sharply this year. \"The record in peso terms is more an effect of the currency\\'s devaluation than anything else,\" said Gustavo Ber, senior economist at local consultancy Estudio Ber. \"The stock market is not reacting to fundamentals as much as it is to money flows,\" said Ber, adding it was \"mostly hot money\" meaning traders ready to cash gains. The Merval is off 12% since hitting a record high on Monday.  Ber said the global \"risk-on\" mentality was first seen in the performance of Argentine stocks traded in U.S. exchanges and those speculative bets were later reflected in the local market.

What makes Argentina exceptional is that all its major stocks are listed in New York as ADRs, offering international investors an easy way to play Argentina. \"That means a lot of stocks remain investable under a sovereign default which would normally put equities off limits,\" said Dubai-based Hasnain Malik, emerging markets equity strategist at Tellimer. Some like Mercado Libre (O: ) and Globant (K: ) offer investors exposure further afield. They are based in Argentina but generate most revenues internationally. \"While there are still massive uncertainties ahead for the sovereign debt restructuring and the economy, there are unique circumstances for one or two of these ADR listings,\" Malik said. Mercado Libre\\'s ADR is up near 50% this year and 75% this quarter alone. The local stock (BA: ), up 137% this quarter, is not part of the Merval index. Argentina exposure has the sixth-largest overweight among active global emerging market funds at +0.66% above benchmark, according to Copley Fund Research. Some 40% of active Global EM funds in a sample of 224 were invested in Argentina and 38% are overweight the country.  Mercado Libre is also a favorite. GQG Partners, Merian Global Investors and Fisher have all opened new positions in that stock this year, said Copley founder Steven Holden. \"Confidence is starting to return with ownership and allocations rising over the last 6 months,\" said Holden.

Stock markets sold off aggressively Thursday, after the Federal Reserve had warned of a slow recovery for the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, from the ravages of the Covid-19 virus as well as renewed fears of a second wave as economies are gradually reopened. The three major U.S. stock indices fell more than 5%, posting their worst day since mid-March, while the three main indices in Europe--the  , the CAC 40 and the   100--all dropped around 4%. However, this selloff came after equities had been on the tear since late March, with the   reaching record highs and the   climbing over 40% from March lows in the U.S.. Europe has seen a similar picture. This has created a difficult decision for investors - do they accept this hefty drop as a blip and continue positioning for the upward trend, or is this move lower the start of a concerted selloff? “Certainly there are going to be some second-wave concerns so it is right for the market to be worried about that...we also had seen an incredible rally from the bottom so the idea that investors might be looking to take some profits here is certainly what’s driving the sell-off as well,” said Lori Heinel,   (NYSE: ) Global Advisors deputy global chief investment officer, Bloomberg reported.

There’s an abundance of data due later Friday that could put this tone to the test. The U.K. suffered a record drop in output in April, in the height of its lockdown, while Tesla’s stock is losing some investment banking friends after its meteoric rise. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, June 12th. U.S. stock markets are set to surge Friday, rebounding after Thursday’s sharp selloff which has acted as a reality check given the strong gains on Wall Street over the last couple of months. By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the   contract was up 587 points or 2.3%, while the   contract was up 1.9% and the   contract was 1.6% higher. Wall Street tumbled in a broad sell-off on Thursday, with the Dow suffering its biggest one-day decline since the middle of March, as a jump in new Covid-19 infections threatened to slow down the pace of the reopenings prompting investors to ditch stocks and flee to safety.\\xa0\\xa0 The   fell 6.9%, or 1,861 points. The   fell 5.9%, while the   slumped 5.3%.\\xa0 The indices are on track to end a spell of three winning weeks, with the DJIA down 7% so far, the S&P 500 down 6% and the Nasdaq Composite 3% lower. “Equities had been trading in large part due to three factors: a V-shaped recovery of the real economy and earnings, optimism on the medical and public health front, and the likelihood of additional support from both the Fed and the fiscal authorities,” said John Velis, FX and Macro Strategist, Americas, BNY Mellon (NYSE: ) in a note to clients. Britain\\'s  suffered a record collapse in April, shrinking by 20.4% in April from March as the country spent the month in a tight coronavirus lockdown. \"Record GDP falls in today’s figures. When taking April and March together the economy is 25% smaller. The economy in April the same size as it was in 2002,\" ONS statistician Rob Kent-Smith said on Twitter. \"Virtually all areas of the economy were hit, with pubs, education, health and car sales all giving the biggest contributions to this historic fall,\" said Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics. These figures are particularly weak when compared with the U.K.’s main European rivals.\\xa0 The Bank of France estimated Thursday that the French economy would show a 15% quarterly contraction in the April-June period, while German industrial output dropped by 17.9% in April from March. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development did warn on Wednesday that Britain was on course for the worst downturn among all the major economic powers, forecasting its economy would contract 11.5% this year. There are a number of economic indicators due for release Friday, with the Michigan   survey, due at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT), the main release. Expectations are for a number of 75 for June, up from 72.5 the prior month, with sentiment likely on the rise as businesses are reopening and individual restrictions are being loosened in much of the country. That said, the number of cases of the virus continues to rise in a number of the more populous states, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell was downbeat in his assessment of the economic outlook earlier this week. Before this, May\\'s  , which measures the change in the price of imported goods and services purchased in the U.S., is expected to come in at 0.6% compared with a contraction of 2.6% for the prior month.\\xa0 May\\'s   is also due and is expected to be a gain of 0.6% compared to a contraction of 3.3% the prior month. The figure tracks changes in U.S. exports to determine whether there was an increase in goods sold abroad or merely an increase in the price of exported goods.\\xa0 Both indices are due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).\\xa0 Crude oil prices were mixed Friday after Thursday’s sharp losses amid fears a surge in new coronavirus infections in many U.S. states could hinder a fragile recovery in demand at the world’s largest consumer, while swelling stockpiles raised fresh concerns about excess supply. However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the U.S. shouldn’t shut down the economy again even if there is another jump in coronavirus cases, helping the tone Friday. “In our view, the bar for turning to lockdowns again seems very high,” said Danske Bank, in a note to clients. “Not least in the U.S., where there is strong opposition to this.” Additionally, “the oil market has been overdue a pullback, with prices getting somewhat ahead of actual fundamentals,” said Warren Patterson head of commodities strategy at ING Bank NV in Singapore. “While the market is moving from a surplus to deficit environment, inventories remain at elevated levels and refinery margins are still very weak.” Oil is heading for the first weekly loss since late April, also weighed by an increase in American crude stockpiles to a record high which raised fresh concerns about a potential supply glut. Attention will turn Friday to the weekly release of the Baker Hughes rig count, an important business barometer for the oil drilling industry.\\xa0 By 6:30 AM ET,   futures were down 0.2% at $36.26 a barrel, while the global benchmark   was 0.2% higher at $38.61 a barrel. Tesla stock has been one of the most desired on Wall Street over the last year or so, climbing around 145% this year, making the California-based electric-vehicle maker the top performer on the Nasdaq. The stock climbed above $1,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday, resulting in a market capitalization of $120 billion, nearing that of Toyota, the biggest automaker in the world. However, this may be the time for investors to think carefully about owning the stock, at least that what a couple of investment banking giants think.  (NYSE: ) downgraded Tesla to underweight earlier Friday, saying its elevated price doesn’t properly reflect emerging risks, citing price cuts in China and the U.S.. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) also cut its investment stance on the car maker Friday to neutral on a 12-month basis, citing a lofty valuation. However, it remained positive on the stock over the longer term. \\xa0 Add a Comment'], ['Investing.com – U.S. stocks were higher after the close on Friday, as gains in the  ,   and   sectors led shares higher.

A flood of liquidity in the form of fiscal and economic stimulus, along with uneven but steady re-openings of state and local economies, sparked a remarkable rally in the stock market since its late-March trough. But surging new cases of COVID-19 in China, where the pandemic originated, prompted the reintroduction of containment measures, and record hospitalizations in several U.S. states dampened investor risk appetite. On the flipside, an uptick in China\\'s factory output and a much better-than-expected Empire State manufacturing report gave evidence that the pandemic-hobbled global economy was on the road to recovery. Earlier, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced it had opened registration for its Main Street Lending program to help businesses weather the storm of mandated lockdowns.

However, President Donald Trump said late on Wednesday the United States would not close businesses again.

A resurgence in coronavirus infections has kept the S&P 500 and Dow indexes in a narrow range since last week, with the S&P 500 now 8% below its February all-time high after coming within 5% of that level last week. \"The market has fully priced in a majority of the gains coming out of this recovery phase and it\\'s not really going to go much higher until we get better data down the road,\" said Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist at Delos Capital Advisors, in Dallas, Texas.

Fast forward to 2020 and there are only approximately 4,400 — a drop of 46% despite the fact that the   quadrupled in value. Conventional wisdom would lead readers to think they are looking at a misprint. This paradox has led to efforts from both the public and private sectors to help jump-start initial public offerings. Unfortunately, legislation like the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS, has not had the desired impact, and companies have instead elected to stay private longer than they once did. While we could chalk this up to capital being freely available via private equity and venture funds, the simple fact is that, for smaller companies, the benefits do not currently outweigh the burden and expense of going public. Legislation like Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, the additional scrutiny that comes with being a public company, and byzantine U.S. equity market structure are all partially to blame. Fortunately, the pace of formation of private companies is at a record high and entrepreneurism is alive and well in the U.S. There has been a 106% growth in the number of private equity-backed companies from 4,000 in 2006 to more than 8,000 in 2017. While we champion the formation of new innovative companies, the shift from public to private ownership has had the negative side effect of locking out most public investors from the rewards of ownership. AOL, Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Intel (NASDAQ: ), Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and many other successful companies went public early in their evolution. Now, with large companies going public later, private investors reap most of the financial gains by the timeshares that are available on a listed exchange.

Add a Comment'], ['(Bloomberg) -- Whether it’s a bearish portent of a sell-off to come or prudent hedging after a fierce stock rebound, traders are bolstering their defenses against an end to this vertiginous rally. Gold and longer-maturity bonds are getting outsized inflows. Protective equity options are outdrawing speculative contracts, while volatility markets are positioning for fresh disruptions. It comes as signs of froth are emerging. The   Index is on the cusp of its best quarter in more than 80 years even as fears of a second coronavirus wave grow. Speculative mania reigns among retail investors, while the likes of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co. are turning bullish on U.S. stocks. But for all the fears that Wall Street is running headlong into risk in one of the fastest rebounds ever, hedging demand shows the frenzy is being met with some vigilance. Yellow Metal Net bullish bets on gold in futures and options have risen for the first time in four weeks, recovering from a one-year low, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: ), the world’s biggest exchange-traded fund holding bullion, took in the most in about a year at $1.3 billion on Friday, in large part a sign of enduring faith in the defensive asset. One reason: bulls keep finding their faith rewarded, with the price of bullion edging toward the highest since 2012. Duration Demand Almost $10 billion flowed into fixed-income ETFs last week, favoring funds targeting government and investment grade debt over those buying riskier junk bonds. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ: ) ETF, ticker TLT, which buys only longer-dated government notes, had its best week in seven with $600 million of inflows. Money market-like ETFs added assets for the first time since early May. After two-and-a-half years of bearish bets against Treasuries, hedge fund positions are now nearly completely neutral, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. “A new lockdown is not in the price for equities, but a slowdown is creeping in the price of bonds” said Ben Emons, head of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. “The near-term risk for markets optimism about the reopening could be a more pronounced summer slowdown than what is expected.” Fear Gauge The traditionally inverse correlation between stocks and the Cboe Volatility Index, the fear gauge on Wall Street, has been turned on its head recently, with the   rising even on days when market has rallied.  Inc (NYSE: ). strategists note that “the VIX should be much lower - the gap between VIX and S&P 500 returns is one of the largest on record.” While part of that may be down to investors chasing bullish call contracts, it may also be a sign that options markets are “less optimistic on growth so far and that equities have run up a bit too fast,” they wrote in a recent note. Stock Hedging Meanwhile, JPMorgan strategists argue that there’s been plenty of stock hedging among institutional investors, despite all the focus on speculative call buying by moms and pops. A measure of the price of protective puts versus bullish calls known as skew has been steadily rising for the S&P 500 and   indexes, they wrote in a note on Friday. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P. \\xa0 Add a Comment'], ['By\\xa0Christiana Sciaudone Investing.com -- Mobile payments provider Square rose 6.4% to close at $104.22 Monday after analysts raised their price targets for the stock.

The   has rallied more than 35% from its pandemic low in late March through last week, even as virus deaths mounted, the U.S. locked down and the unemployment rate soared. The IMF said that such rallies have occurred in past periods of significant economic pressure, only to quickly unwind. Credit spreads for investment-grade companies in advanced economies also are narrower than during past economic shocks, the fund said. “This divergence raises the specter of another correction in risk asset prices should investors’ attitude change, posing a threat to the recovery,” Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department, and Fabio Natalucci, the deputy director, said in a blog post accompanying the Global Financial Stability update on Thursday. A sell-off could add financial stress on top of a recession that’s already projected to be the worst since the Great Depression. The fund also warned that high debt levels may become unmanageable for some borrowers, with insolvencies and resulting losses testing bank resilience. Emerging- and frontier-market economies face refinancing risks, and authorities should closely monitor financial vulnerabilities while continuing to safeguard stability, the Washington-based lender said. The IMF on Wednesday downgraded its outlook for the coronavirus-ravaged world economy, projecting a significantly deeper recession and slower recovery than it anticipated just two months ago. The fund said it now expects global gross domestic product to shrink 4.9% this year, compared with the 3% predicted in April. Central banks in advanced economies have cut interest rates to about or below zero to buffer the effect of the coronavirus. While that along with the extensive use of tools such as quantitative easing has “restored confidence and boosted investor risk taking,” Adrian and Natalucci urged policy makers “to be attentive to possible unintended consequences, such as a continued buildup of financial vulnerabilities in an environment of easy financial conditions.” ©2020 Bloomberg L.P. \\xa0 Add a Comment'], ['By Peter Nurse\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Thursday after Wednesday’s sharp losses, with investors showing caution amid signs that cases of the COVID-19 pandemic are accelerating, hampering efforts to reopen the country’s economy.

The U.S. stock market has consistently outperformed Europe since the 2016 election of Trump, which was followed by a rally widely dubbed the \\'Trump bump\\'. Fund flows suggest a shift in sentiment. Bank of America (NYSE: )\\'s latest weekly report on Friday showed $6.6 billion left U.S. equity funds, the largest exodus in seven weeks, while $800 million made their way into European ones. The pan-European STOXX 600 has outperformed world stocks by about 1.5% in the last month, while Wall Street\\'s S&P 500 ( ) has underperformed by the same extent. Among factors boosting European assets is Europe\\'s relative success in gradually reopening its economy and the European Union\\'s proposed 750 billion euro ($841.73 billion) recovery fund to help countries deal with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis.  The spending plan, which could be approved in July, would bring the EU closer to a fiscal union and as such has boosted sentiment and soothed recurrent worries about peripheral euro zone countries such as Italy.  The common currency has risen 4% since France and Germany unveiled a joint proposal for the recovery fund on May 18.

Meanwhile, the U.S. newsflow was less favourable, with record COVID-19 infections and jobs data suggesting the labour market could take years to recover.  Opinion polls give Biden a substantial lead over Trump both nationally and in key states, and betting odds currently give the Democrat candidate a 60% chance of winning. Goldman Sachs said the possibility of a Biden victory - and the possible reversal of Trump\\'s 2017 tax cuts - wasn\\'t fully priced into markets. Given the uncertainty of the race and bearing in mind the surprise win of Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016, many may choose to stay on the sidelines and wait for the dust to settle. \"European equities may get an edge over their U.S. peers as we get closer to the U.S. election,\"   (NYSE: )\\'s head of cross-asset strategy Andrew Sheets told Reuters.

The planemaker\\'s (N: ) shares jumped more than 14% after a 737 MAX took off on Monday from a Seattle-area airport on the first day of certification flight testing with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and company test pilots, a crucial moment in Boeing\\'s worst-ever crisis. A spike in virus infections in Southern and Western states last week sent the S&P 500 down nearly 3%, but the threat of a deeper-than-feared recession has led investors to expect more stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve or Congress. But the sting of rising infections was blunted by the pricing of the antiviral drug remdesivir, which has been shown to alter the course of COVID-19, by Gilead Sciences (O: ). The company also agreed to send nearly all of its supply of the drug to the United States over the next three months. While the S&P 500 is up more than 17% for the quarter, the index is down slightly for the month, as stocks have been buffeted by signs of progress in battling the coronavirus and a recent resurgence in cases. \"For all the up, for all the down, volatility isn’t going anywhere,\" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. \"Maybe that is the lesson of June, these one-day moves seem impressive but you string 20 of them together and you’ve got nothing.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) rose 580.25 points, or 2.32%, to 25,595.8, the S&P 500 ( ) gained 44.19 points, or 1.47%, to 3,053.24 and the Nasdaq Composite ( ) added 116.93 points, or 1.2%, to 9,874.15.

Coming off a drop of 20% in the first quarter, the biggest quarterly decline since the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008, the S&P rallied more than 19.95% to notch its biggest quarterly gain since 1998, at the height of the tech boom.  The gains have been fueled by unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus and the easing of restrictions.  But the S&P 500 is still down about 4% on the year, and gains in June stood at just 2% due to the flare-up in virus cases that has threatened to delay reopenings and derail a tentative economic recovery. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated in comments on Tuesday that the path of the economy is \"highly uncertain.\" \"What everybody sees is if we can get something that puts an end to the spread or the spread becomes less, there is literally so much money out there that the Fed has put out there that when we turn, it is going to be a rocket ship the other way,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ: ) in Chicago.  Still, comments from Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government\\'s top infectious diseases expert, who said there was no guarantee the United States will have an effective COVID-19 vaccine and warned the virus spread \"could get very bad,\" were a reminder that a full economic recovery could be a long road. Gains were capped on the Dow, pressured by a 5.75% drop in   (N: ), as the airplane maker gave back some of Monday\\'s 14% surge after Norwegian Air (OL: ) canceled orders for 97 aircraft and said it would claim compensation.

The 17.78% gain in the Dow marked its best quarterly performance since a 21.56% rally in the first quarter of 1987 while the Nasdaq\\'s 30.63% jump was its best quarter since a 48.18% gain in the fourth quarter of 1999.  While coronavirus cases continue to surge in many states, the U.S. economy is showing signs of pickup, with data indicating consumer confidence increased much more than expected in June.

Plenty can change in the four months before the Nov. 3 vote, and many investors remain focused on whether a resurgence of the coronavirus will damage a nascent U.S. economic rebound.  Some money managers, however, are already preparing for the possibility of a Biden victory by betting against the dollar and cutting their positions in U.S. stocks.  \"The president\\'s poll numbers have fallen off a cliff,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE: ). \"The market is looking at this and saying, \\'If the election were held today Biden would win.\\'” The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed Biden leading Trump by 8 percentage points among registered voters.

Citi equity strategists are recommending clients play it safe by holding U.S. stocks and healthcare shares and reducing exposure to bank shares, as earnings are likely to take a while to recover from the coronavirus fallout. \"The bullish push from $6 trillion of global quantitative easing is likely to cancel out the bearish drag from the ongoing lockdown,\" the investment bank\\'s equity strategists said in a note published late on Sunday. Restrictive measures imposed to contain the virus has ravaged economic activity and hurt demand for risky assets in recent months, but their impact has been offset somewhat by huge asset buying from central banks, which has supported confidence. \"We would not chase markets higher from current levels,\" the strategists said. The note forecasts the S&P 500 ( ) to be at 3,160 points in mid-2021, about 1% higher than Friday\\'s close. It expects other major markets from Australia ( ) to Europe ( ) and Japan ( ) to be similarly steady.

In Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, which were among the first states to reopen commerce in May, retail foot traffic now lags levels elsewhere, data firm Unacast said.  More than 60,000 new COVID-19 infections were reported on Wednesday, the greatest single-day tally of cases by any country since the virus emerged late last year in China. U.S. deaths rose by more than 900 for the second straight day. Florida on Thursday announced nearly 9,000 new cases and 120 new coronavirus deaths, a record daily increase in lives lost. California and Texas, the most populous states, announced record increases in COVID deaths on Wednesday. The surge is making some Americans hesitant to return to public spaces and patronize businesses despite President Donald Trump\\'s efforts to downplay the risks.  Stephanie Porta, 41, a lifelong resident of Orlando, Florida, said only about half the people at her grocery store wore masks but that was an improvement from two weeks ago.  \"They\\'re trying to make everything seem normal, when it\\'s not. People are dying, people are getting sick. It\\'s insane,\" she said. \"A lot of people are taking notice. But so many are being fed the message that everything is normal.

The reduction in the conglomerate\\'s outstanding shares was noted in a Wednesday filing concerning Buffett\\'s $2.9 billion donation of Berkshire stock to five nonprofits, part of his pledge to give away nearly all his fortune. If Berkshire repurchased those shares, it might have conducted roughly $4.9 billion to $5.9 billion of buybacks, depending on the price, over 2-1/2 months, analysts said.\"It implies relatively strong buyback activity,\" said James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst with a \"buy\" rating on Berkshire. \"There is certainly capacity.\" He said buybacks might have totaled $5.3 billion, based on Berkshire\\'s average share price from April 23 to July 7.Since bottoming on March 23, Berkshire\\'s share price had through Thursday risen 12%, lagging the Standard & Poor\\'s 500\\'s 41% gain. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buybacks could help Buffett reduce Berkshire\\'s cash hoard, which totaled $137.2 billion as of March 31. It has been 4-1/2 years since the legendary billionaire completed a major acquisition for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, though Berkshire did agree last Sunday to pay $4 billion for some gas assets from Dominion Energy Inc. Buffett\\'s buyback appetite had been relatively muted since July 2018, when a policy change let him and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger repurchase stock when they thought its price was below Berkshire\\'s intrinsic value.  The old policy allowed buybacks only at prices up to 1.2 times book value. Shanahan estimated Berkshire\\'s current multiple at 1.1. Berkshire\\'s previous buybacks under the current policy totaled about $8 billion, including $1.7 billion from January to March as the coronavirus pandemic drove down the price. Wednesday\\'s filing said Buffett owned the equivalent of 248,741 Class A shares, a 15.54% stake, following his donations.  That suggests Berkshire had the equivalent of just over 1.6 million Class A shares outstanding, down roughly 19,000 from April 23. Some investors believe Berkshire\\'s cash has hurt its stock price.

Trump has justified his public assurances that the virus will quickly go away by arguing he needs to be \"a cheerleader\" for the United States to avoid creating \"havoc and shock.\" The United States has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections and deaths in the world. \"We simply never believed \\'what happens in China stays in China,\\'\" Singh wrote in a letter to investors last week that was seen by Reuters. \"Trump talking down COVID-19 risk gave investors an incredible gift -- it kept markets resilient much longer than they should have, and enabled us to ensure our portfolio was sensibly positioned.\" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Axon, a 15-year-old hedge fund which oversees roughly $1 billion, gained 24.3% in the first half of the year, thanks to bets on technology giants, managed-care stocks and Japanese companies, according to the letter. In the last days Axon extended gains and is now up 30%. Axon is among a small number of firms beating the average hedge fund, which lost 3.5% in the first half, according to Hedge Fund Research data. Singh said he was able to \"bulk up\" some hedges early in the year by \"adding some volatility protection.\" That weighed on \"performance in January and early February, but has helped ever since.\" The novel coronavirus first emerged in China last December. The first U.S. case, in Washington state, was reported in mid-January, and through late February U.S. cases reported remained low. During that period Wall Street stocks continued to rally, with the Nasdaq and the Dow posting record highs on Feb. 19. And after the benchmark S&P 500 ( ), the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) and the Nasdaq ( ) all suffered double-digit declines in the first quarter, all three marked their biggest quarterly percentage gains in more than two decades in the second quarter. The S&P was still down on the year at the close of the first half, but the Dow and the Nasdaq both closed out the period higher. For Axon, bets on Google owner Alphabet Inc (O: ),   (O: ), health insurers   (N: ) and Humana (N: ), medical equipment maker Olympus (T: ), and short bets against retailers, including Gap (N: ) and Kohls (N: ), all paid off. Olympus is up 20.66% this year.  A former Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) stock picker, Singh founded Axon with capital from private-equity firm TPG in 2005. The fund\\'s assets peaked at $13 billion in 2008. After the stock market\\'s plunge in March and subsequent recovery, Singh now worries about a rise in interest rates. \"All investors should think seriously about buying \\'protection\\' against structural rise in interest rates,\" he wrote.

Adding to the reasons to be cautious was increased tension between China and the U.S., the globe’s two economic powerhouses.

Add a Comment'], ['By April Joyner NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options investors are ramping up bets on some of this year\\'s biggest winners, including Amazon.com Inc (O: ), Netflix Inc (O: ) and Tesla Inc (O: ), even as they turn cautious on the wider market amid a resurgent U.S. coronavirus outbreak. Investors are betting that tech-related stocks will remain comparatively resilient to the coronavirus-fueled economic disruptions that have battered sectors such as retail and travel, despite growing concerns about stretched valuations following steep rallies. Analysts also see another factor driving the momentum stocks: fear of missing out, or FOMO. The rocket-like rise of such stocks has driven year-to-date gains for the S&P 500 technology ( ), consumer discretionary ( ) and communication services ( ) sectors, though the broader S&P 500 ( ) benchmark index remains negative for the year. Amazon is a component of the consumer discretionary index, and Netflix is a component of the communication services index. \"The flight to safety is in tech,\" said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \"These tend to be the names that are insulated from the fact that everyone is quarantined.\" Fears of further economic fallout from the coronavirus mounted on Monday as California reinstituted restrictions on businesses and the state\\'s two largest public school districts announced instruction would be online-only when school resumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq toggled between gains and losses Tuesday, a day after falling 2.1%, its biggest percentage loss in more than two weeks. But the purchase of bullish call options in tech-related names hasn\\'t been dampened. For instance, demand for calls versus bearish put options - a measure called skew - on Tesla currently stands near historic extremes, even after the stock has rallied more than 300% from its March lows. Tesla\\'s 30-day skew is negative, at -15.2%, according to Trade Alert, meaning that prices for calls have surged past those for equivalent puts. Skew in Amazon, Netflix, Twitter and other momentum stocks has also been negative in the past week. By contrast, skew on the S&P 500 shows a growing bias toward puts. \"You have almost a perfect storm,\" said Matt Amberson, principal at options analytics firm ORATS. \"There\\'s a little bit of institutional worry, but retail (investors) ... are bullish.\" Still, there are plenty of concerns about technology stocks. Fund managers in a recent BofA Global Research survey said buying tech stocks was the market\\'s \"most crowded\" trade for a third straight month. In addition, some strategists believe the sharp run-up could make tech-related shares more vulnerable should the companies\\' growth outlooks fall short of investors\\' hopes. The second-quarter earnings season began in earnest on Tuesday as several major U.S. banks reported results. After the recent rally, many tech-related shares have \"the type of valuation where you would want to take profits,\" said Oliver Pursche, president at Bronson Meadows Capital Management. Indeed, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500, at 22.1, according to Refinitiv, is at its highest level since the dot-com boom two decades ago. Some investors have chosen to bet on stocks that are outside the technology sector but may be positioned to benefit from a nascent economic recovery. Skew has dipped for several companies seen as being among the greatest beneficiaries of an economic recovery, including   (N: ) and Delta Air Lines (N: ). Other recent call buyers include investors who want exposure to potential gains but are hesitant to buy stocks at current prices, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group, a trend he said has occurred in tech-related names such as Tesla and   (TO: ) (N: ). \"We\\'re seeing a FOMO phenomenon being priced in,\" he said.

Data from fund research firm Refinitiv Lipper showed passive equity funds, which are mutual funds that mirror stock indexes, attracted $860 million in June, after a combined outflow of $24.5 billion in the previous two months.  On the other hand, active funds where fund managers promise selective stock investing to beat index performance, witnessed sharp outflows in every month in the first half of this year. (Graphic: Flows into active and passive funds, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmgzqbpr/flows1.JPG)  Analysts said June marked a return to the long-term trend, in which passive funds attract a larger proportion of equity investments compared with active funds. Passive funds outperformed active funds in terms of price returns during 9 of the past 10 years, the data showed. (Graphic: Price performance of active and passive funds, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplxnqjpb/price1.JPG)  \"While markets are swiftly recovering from the COVID-induced drawdown, the cash which rushed to the sidelines has a tendency to find its way back into the market in the easiest and most fluid manner possible: passive,\" said Michael White, portfolio manager at Picton Mahoney Asset Management. \"There is massive pent-up demand and ample liquidity furnished by both monetary and fiscal policy,\" he said, referring to liquidity from stimulus measures as lockdown restrictions to curb the spread of the new coronavirus are gradually eased. According to Lipper data, money market funds attracted $988.3 billion in the first half of this year, while equity funds saw an outflow of $171.7 billion. The demand for passive funds has also been driven by the narrow stock-market rally, with investors favoring well-established large-cap stocks which are already part of the major stock index, analysts said.  The market-cap weighted benchmark S&P 500 index ( ), which allocates more weighting to the performance of large-cap stocks, has recovered most of its first-quarter losses and is just down 1% for this year.  On the other hand, the equal-weighted S&P 500 index ( ), which weighs all stock constituents equally, is still down 10% so far this year.

Earnings will swing into high gear, with investors hoping that some big names could offer better news in what has been a dismal season so far. Thursday’s jobless claims report will likely show that the number of people filing for benefits barely declined once again, with millions still out of work. In the euro zone, leaders are still trying to hammer out a deal on a possible recovery fund worth 750 billion euro, while PMI data on Friday will give more insight into the speed of the post lockdown economic bounceback. Here’s what you need to know to start your week. Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate will resume contentious talks on a new coronavirus-aid bill this week as the U.S. economy approaches a critical stage in the recovery from the pandemic. Extended unemployment benefits for the approximately 32 million Americans out of work are due to end on July 31. The expiration of the Federal program will leave millions of gig workers and the self employed among others, who do not qualify for regular state unemployment insurance, without an income. On Thursday, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer unveiled a $350 billion investment plan, but Republicans have said they hope the final package will not cost more than $1 trillion. With the two sides still far apart on several issues, analysts fear that a less generous package of aid measures will mean that the already fragile economic rebound will lose momentum in the coming months.

Tesla's stock was down 3% in afternoon trading, eroding a recent rally that has elevated the company's market capitalization to almost $300 billion, larger than any other carmaker.  Despite Tuesday's stock dip, and importantly for Musk's personal finances, Tesla’s six-month average market capitalization for the first time has reached $150 billion. That triggers the vesting of the second of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire in his 2018 pay package to buy Tesla stock at a discount. Musk, who is also majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary.  Even with Tuesday's decline in Tesla's stock, its six-month average market capitalization rose, thanks to the stock's strong rally in recent months. In early May, Musk’s first tranche vested after Tesla’s six-month average stock market value reached $100 billion. Musk has already achieved targets related to Tesla’s financial growth that are also required in order to vest the latest options tranche. Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each, less than a quarter of their current price. At Tesla’s current stock price of $1,594, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the tranche that vested in May and the current tranche for a combined profit of $4.2 billion, or almost $2.1 billion per tranche. Musk’s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has since increased along with Tesla’s stock price. The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing.  Tesla's stock has surged more than 500% over the past year as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan. Following higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, some investors believe Tesla might report a profit in its second-quarter report on Wednesday after the bell. That would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla and a key hurdle for it to be added to the S&P 500 index ( ).  Analysts on average expect a $240 million loss for the quarter, according to Refinitiv. A month ago, analysts expected a loss of almost $340 million.

Investors watching the company\\'s quarterly report after the bell will be laser-focused on one question: Was Tesla profitable?  A net profit, under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla and a key hurdle for it to be added to the benchmark S&P 500 index ( ).  While analysts on average expect a loss, estimates improved after Tesla reported higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries earlier this month, helping push the stock up about more than 47% so far in July. Tesla shares were last up 1.5% at $1,591.48.  BofA Global Research raised its Tesla price target to $800 from $500, maintaining its \"underperform\" rating. \"The technical buying ahead of (Tesla\\'s) potential addition to the S&P 500 has added fuel to the run,\" BofA analyst John Murphy wrote in client note. \"However, in our view, the $1,500+ stock price is not supported by fundamentals, with valuation driven largely by momentum and low rates.\" Analysts on average expect a $240 million loss for the quarter, compared with an estimated loss of almost $340 million a month ago, according to Refinitiv.  With a market capitalization of about $295 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500, larger than 95% of the index’s existing components. It would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index.

Eligible candidates are considered by an index committee that weighs factors including sector balance and size representation. The index committee does not make changes based on a specific timetable.  Investment funds that replicate the S&P 500 have at least $4.4 trillion of assets, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, and those funds would need to buy Tesla shares quickly to avoid errors tracking the index’s performance. Ivan Cajic, head of index and ETF research at Virtu Financial (NASDAQ: ), estimated index managers would need to own roughly 25 million Tesla shares, currently worth about $40 billion. Additionally, actively managed investment funds that benchmark their performance to the S&P 500 would be forced to decide whether to buy Tesla shares.

Tesla said it earned net income of $104 million from April to June, or $0.50 per share, marking the first time the company has posted a profit for four straight quarters, a condition for it to be considered for the stock index of the largest U.S. companies. (See graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3hw2RwV) The performance is a major accomplishment for Chief Executive Elon Musk, whose mission of leading the global auto industry into an electric future has frequently been questioned by investors who doubted Tesla\\'s viability. Its shares have gained more than 500% over the past year. Many analysts believe the rally has been fueled in part by expectations of Tesla\\'s imminent inclusion in the stock index, which would unleash a flood of demand for shares. Musk on a conference call on Wednesday said Tesla would prioritize growth over profit going forward and focus on making its vehicles more affordable. \"The thing that bugs me most right now is that our cars are not affordable enough, we need to fix that,\" Musk said on the call. \"I think we just want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible.\" The price of a Model 3 sedan, its most popular vehicle, starts at $37,990 in the United States. Musk also announced that Travis County, Texas, which includes Austin, would be the site of Tesla\\'s new factory. The area had been competing with Tulsa, Oklahoma, for the new plant, which promises to create at least 5,000 jobs. Musk said the factory would produce Model 3 and Model Y vehicles for the Eastern United States, as well as a new semi-truck called the Tesla Semi and the carmaker\\'s futuristic Cybertruck. Tesla on Wednesday affirmed its goal to deliver at least half a million vehicles by the end of 2020 despite production interruptions, including the shutting of its California factory for nearly six weeks of the quarter on orders of local authorities. The company delivered more than 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. \"While achieving this goal has become more difficult, delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 remains our target,\" the company said. Musk said on Wednesday\\'s call that the real limitation to Tesla\\'s growth is battery cell production at an affordable price, and said the company would expand its business with Panasonic Corp (T: ) and China\\'s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) (SZ: ). Tesla will introduce new low-cost, long-life batteries in its Model 3 sedan in China later this year or early next, Reuters reported previously. Tesla\\'s second-quarter revenue fell to $6.04 billion from $6.35 billion a year earlier, but surpassed analyst expectations for revenue of $5.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Tesla reported $5.18 billion in second-quarter automotive revenue, but its share of income from regulatory credits - payments the company receives from other carmakers to offset emissions - increased to $428 million from $354 million in the first quarter. That revenue could dry up as more manufacturers develop and sell electric cars, but many rivals are still focused on reaping the high profit margins from fuel-guzzling trucks and SUVs. \"Right now in the EV market, it\\'s Tesla\\'s world and everyone else is paying rent, a dynamic shown front and center this quarter,\" Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, said in a note. Tesla\\'s rapid rise to become the world\\'s most valuable carmaker could mark the start of a new era for the global auto industry, defined by a Silicon Valley approach to software that is overtaking old-school manufacturing know-how. The company said higher income from those regulatory credits in combination with temporary employee salary cuts during the pandemic and $48 million in deferred revenue from its yet-to-be-released self-driving feature offset the cost of factory shutdowns.

The company, which is still carrying $152 billion of net debt after its acquisition of Time Warner, said revenue fell over 10% from a year earlier to $41.0 billion while underlying earnings per share fell 6.8% to 83 cents a share, from 89c a year ago. Earnings were around 5% higher than expected, while revenue was broadly in line with street forecasts. AT&T company said that almost all of the profit decline - 6c a share – was due to pandemic-related impacts that it expected to be transitory. It estimated that Covid-19 had reduced revenue by $2.81 billion, largely through lower advertising revenue, and had depressed EBITDA by $510 million. Despite this, net debt stayed largely stable at 2.63 times EBITDA. The pattern of recent quarters continued, with the loss of another 886,000 premium TV customers in the quarter. However, this was partially offset by the launch of HBO MAX at the end of May. In contrast to the previous quarter, when it suspended its guidance completely, AT&T said it intends to pay out just over 60% of net profit, and expects gross capital investment of around $20 billion.

With market participants weighing escalating coronavirus cases in southern and western U.S. states and rising tensions between the U.S. and China some of the biggest names in big tech will report earnings. The highlight on the data calendar will be Thursday’s first estimate of U.S. second quarter GDP which will show the full scale of what is expected to have been the largest quarterly contraction ever. Meanwhile, German and euro zone second-quarter GDP figures are also expected to show steep contractions. Here’s what you need to know to start your week. Approximately 32 million Americans on unemployment benefits are currently receiving $600 per week in expanded jobless benefits, but this is due to expire on July 31st. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday said that the Trump administration supports extending enhanced unemployment benefits until the end of the year in the next round of coronavirus aid, albeit at a reduced level. The administration and the U.S. Congress have been trying to hammer out a deal on the next round of pandemic relief and Republicans are expected to unveil their proposed measures early in the week which will then be debated. However, it is unclear whether an agreement can be reached before the current package of expanded jobless benefits expires, which means there could be harder times ahead. The Fed will probably sit on its hands at its July 28-29   after already slashing interest rates to near zero and pledging unlimited financial asset purchases. Officials are likely to reiterate guidance that rates will remain near zero until the economy gets back to normal. Fed policymakers have become more downbeat on the economic outlook in recent weeks, with some cautioning that recent improvements in economic data such as job gains may be fleeting amid a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic. “The pandemic remains the key driver of the economy’s course. A thick fog of uncertainty still surrounds us, and downside risks predominate,” Fed governor Lael Brainard said earlier this month.

The U.S. Commerce Department is due to give its first take on second-quarter   on Thursday, with analysts forecasting a bruising 34% annualized decline during the three-month period. The recovery now looks at risk as cases of the virus have exploded across the country, prompting some authorities in the hard-hit South and West regions to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. “Even as the Fed maintains its ultra-loose policy stance and Congress provides further fiscal support, ongoing social distancing requirements are likely to keep GDP well below its pre-virus trend and the unemployment rate elevated over the coming years,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. While data on Monday is expected to show another increase in  , Thursday’s figures on   are expected to remain elevated.

Stocks and bonds\\' moving in parallel is one of the distortions Fed policy makers may ponder when they meet next week, although they are expected to let the emergency measures already implemented in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak work through the financial system.  The recent rise in Treasury prices, which typically climb when investors seek safe harbors during uncertain times, appears at odds with the exuberance seen on Wall Street, where the S&P 500 last week came within 3.5% of its February all-time high, set before it was clear the spread of COVID-19 would wreak havoc around the world.  The S&P 500 500 ( ) and U.S. 10-year Treasury notes ( ) typically move in opposite directions, such that when equities rise during periods of confidence and risk-taking, bond prices fall, pushing yields, which move inversely to prices, higher. Analysts have said the traditionally negative correlation between stocks and bonds reflects the extent to which bonds will effectively hedge against a stocks sell-off, such as what happened during the global financial crisis in 2008. That relationship has broken down at times during the pandemic. For instance, since mid-June, U.S. benchmark 10-year yields have fallen more than 20 basis points, while the S&P 500 has gained roughly 5%. (GRAPHIC: Treasuries vs stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/rlgpdnlxjpo/Pasted%20image%201595601040892.png) Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities in New York, said the irregularity between the two markets can be explained by the stimulus measures undertaken by Congress and quantitative easing on the part of the Federal Reserve.  \"The Fed and the government have pledged ongoing support for the economy, which has pushed risky assets higher,\" he said. \"At the same time, the Fed wants to keep rates low in order to keep stimulus in place and to prevent a tightening in financial conditions.\"  The Fed slashed the fed funds rates to near zero in March and launched lending and unprecedented debt purchasing programs to boost liquidity and stabilize financial markets.  \"The fact that the Fed has been able to purchase so many bonds and also kind of commit to keeping rates so low is obviously going to be a positive for stocks, but meanwhile remove volatility from the rates market,\" said Ben Jeffery, rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The Fed\\'s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday, with no major announcements expected. But it may lay the groundwork for more action in September or in the fourth quarter, analysts said. With U.S. central bank officials resisting negative interest rates, Fed officials have talked about yield curve control as a way to target rates at specific maturities, which should keep borrowing costs ultra-low to spur spending and bolster the economy. The yield curve refers to the line created by plotting the rates of different maturities. A steepening curve, when longer-dated yields rise faster than shorter-dated ones, generally signals a bright economic outlook. Under yield curve control, the Fed would cap yields at a specific point on the curve, by buying 2- or 3-year maturities, for example, to reinforce guidance that rates are not going up anytime soon.  \"We think in September (the Fed) might come out with a little bit more discussion on the impact of potential additional forward guidance measures of which yield curve control is one of those,\" said Tony Rodriguez, head of fixed income strategy at Nuveen. Fed policymakers are likely close to a policy framework about future measures.  \"In March, the Federal Reserve was buying $75 billion in Treasuries and that was to help stabilize the economy,\" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex in New York. \"But now they may consider measures to help stimulate the economy and that would be the new quantitative easing.\" That should compress U.S. bond yields even more and boost stocks further, unraveling once again their supposedly time-tested correlation, analysts said.

The earnings reports, including from   (O: ) - maker of one of the only treatments that has shown a benefit for hospitalized COVID-19 patients - will be closely watched for any developments that could help contain the pandemic, which has claimed some 650,000 lives worldwide and upended economies.  The supply, pricing and profitability for these potential products also will be hot topics for companies reporting this week, including Eli Lilly and Co (N: ), which is developing an antibody treatment for the still rapidly-spreading disease. Earnings reports are also due from British drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L: ) and AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) and France\\'s Sanofi (PA: ), which are working on vaccines in various stages of development. Wall Street also will be looking for any signs of weakness in the companies\\' big-selling products as the virus runs rampant in many U.S. states, which may stop patients with other conditions from going to hospitals or doctors due to infection fears, as was seen earlier in the U.S. outbreak.

Pfizer, which has released early data on its vaccine candidate being developed with German biotech BioNTech SE (F: ), will kick off the week of drugmaker earnings on Tuesday morning.  Investors will be looking for more details on the timing of the vaccine\\'s development after the U.S. government agreed last week to pay nearly $2 billion to buy enough of it to inoculate 50 million people if it proves to be safe and effective. Gilead\\'s antiviral treatment, remdesivir, has become a key weapon for many countries after the intravenously administered medicine helped shorten hospital recovery times in a U.S. trial. But the drug\\'s supply has been an issue with cases spiking in much of the United States and elsewhere. Some other countries have voiced concerns over its availability after the U.S. government said in June it had secured nearly all supplies over the next three months. \"We expect they will sell as much as they can make for the next 6-plus months and it will be needed in 2021 as well,\" Jefferies (NYSE: ) analyst Michael Yee said in a note ahead of Gilead\\'s results on Thursday. With Merck\\'s experimental COVID-19 vaccine trailing others in development, its top-selling cancer drug Keytruda will be under scrutiny when the drugmaker reports results on Friday.

Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday and the negative sentiment continued through the Asian session, with Japan’s   falling on a rising yen and weak start to the earnings season.  But the MSCI world equity index ( ), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up around 0.1% and mixed corporate earnings saw MSCI\\'s main European Index rise around 0.3% at 0757 GMT  \"Global stock markets appear to be starting to get a little wobbly as the latest earnings numbers start to paint a picture of a global economy that could start to face a challenging time in the weeks and months ahead,\" wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK. \"The resurgence of coronavirus cases that are starting to get reported across the world is prompting the realisation that hopes of a V-shaped recovery are starting to look like pie in the sky,\" he added. Deaths from coronavirus in the United States had their biggest one-day increase since May on Tuesday, with this month\\'s spike in infections having forced some states to make a U-turn on reopening their economies. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam warned that the city was on the brink of a large-scale outbreak and tightened lockdown measures. Japan expects the economy to contract this year, with a return to growth next year, four government sources told Reuters. Global airlines cut their coronavirus recovery forecasts on Tuesday, saying it would take until 2024 - a year longer than previously expected - for passenger traffic to return to pre-crisis levels. London\\'s Heathrow called on the government to urgently introduce a passenger testing regime, warning that the country risked losing a game of global \"quarantine roulette\". The  , which steadied overnight, continued falling in early London trading, hitting fresh two-year lows ( ). As sentiment soured, high-grade euro zone bond yields dropped to their lowest in more than two months, with the German 10-year yield at -0.511% ( ). The euro, which rallied last week when European Union leaders agreed on a massive EU-wide recovery fund, climbed 0.4% to $1.1762 ( ). Gold, which rallied to an all-time high of $1,980.57 on Tuesday, slipped to $1956.3200  Oil prices climbed after a surprise drop in U.S. crude inventories was enough to offset concerns about U.S. fuel demand amid record increases in COVID-19 infections in some states.

Investors are focused on the U.S. Federal Reserve, as it begins its two-day meeting. The Fed is expected to sound reassuringly accommodative at its policy review later in the day and perhaps open the door to a higher tolerance for inflation - something dollar bears think could squash real yields and sink the currency even further. Sentiment is also dampened by the U.S. Congress and White House struggling to agree on a new deal to replace enhanced coronavirus unemployment benefits, which are due to expire on Friday.

It will be the first time Apple Inc (O: ), Amazon.com Inc (O: ), Alphabet Inc (O: ) and   (O: ) post financial results on the same day and investors wonder if they can deliver enough to extend a rally that has been central to Wall Street\\'s recovery since March. Deemed \"stay-at-home\" winners as millions of Americans were ordered indoors to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, shares in the big tech players have scaled record highs at a time when the benchmark S&P 500 ( ) is up less than 1% on the year. But with many of Apple\\'s stores still closed and Amazon\\'s e-commerce costs soaring, there are question marks, and some on Wall Street argue that stock prices for all four have been bloated beyond rational valuations. Shares in   (O: ) fell 4.4% the day after its report last week, despite better-than-expected cloud revenue and its stock is now nearly flat on the month after hitting an all-time high in early July. \"It\\'s simply momentum,\" Leo Kelly, founder of Verdence Capital Advisors, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, ahead of the results, due after the closing bell. \"When you have stocks looking like they\\'re moving into a bubble, what you don\\'t know is how far it will go. You can\\'t just look at valuation and say \\'it\\'s going to fall.\\' It can go anywhere and the risk is becoming extremely, extremely high.\"  THREATS Alphabet\\'s Google and Facebook took particularly sharp jabs on Wednesday from Democrats and Republicans who say they have crippled smaller rivals in the quest for market share, the latest blows in an increasingly threatening regulatory landscape. Apple\\'s headache is a slowdown in hardware sales as the world slides into recession, with analysts predicting pandemic disruptions will see revenue fall about 3% and the iPhone business by nearly 14%. Similarly, Facebook and Google are contending with a collapse in marketing spending.

Investors also fretted ahead of high-profile earnings reports and expiration of enhanced employment benefits on Friday while a polarized Congress kept negotiating its next stimulus package.  Second-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data showed the U.S. economy suffered its steepest contraction since the Great Depression, as business activity came to a halt due to lockdowns aimed at fighting the pandemic. Also jobless claims rose last week, adding to signs the momentum of economic recovery has slowed as coronavirus cases spiraled in southern and western U.S. states. Shortly after the data, Trump, raised the idea of a delay in elections. The idea was immediately rejected by both Democrats and his fellow Republicans in Congress, the branch of government with the power to make that change. But while the S&P was still lower it had pared losses sharply by late afternoon after hitting its session low, so far, at 1000 EDT (1400 GMT). \"Markets are trying to stabilize after having the door thrown open to the worry closet,\" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer, Abbot Downing in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Along with weak data, Schleif said worries included upcoming earnings from companies including Apple Inc (O: ) and Amazon.com (O: ) and Washington\\'s battle over stimulus along with uncertainty about the election. But after the initial knee-jerk reaction, she said, people stepped back and focused on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\\'s assurance on Wednesday that the central bank would \"do whatever it takes\" to support the economy.  \"You open the door it comes piling out, you\\'re frightened and then you settle down and start picking stuff up and putting it back where it belongs,\" Schleif said.

Gross domestic product in the bloc shrank by 12.1% from the previous quarter, the European Union\\'s statistics office, Eurostat, said in its flash estimates.

The benchmark index plunged more than 33% from its Feb. 19 high to its low on March 23 as coronavirus-related shutdowns began spreading across world economies. As restrictions eased, and the Federal Reserve pumped trillions into stabilizing markets, many stocks have stormed back, lifting the S&P 500 more than 45% as economic activity slowly returned.  Over the past decade, a focus on growth and momentum has steadily outperformed stock picking based on how undervalued a stock looks. More recently, the Russell 1000 growth ( ) index has risen 53% from the market low on March 23 versus the 37% gain in the Russell 1000 value ( ) index.

Recent data on the economy and the latest policy statement from the Federal Reserve offered a dim view on the prospect of a quick recovery.  \"It is virtually impossible for value to start to get sponsorship unless and until we have a better answer on economic growth,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. \"So you are never going to see a value sector, value company, value investor shine unless the projection for economic growth significantly improves and we don’t really have that necessarily this year.\"  The Commerce Department said on Thursday that gross domestic product collapsed at a 32.9% annualized rate, the steepest decline in output since the government began to keep records in 1947, while weekly initial jobless claims increased to 1.434 million. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the recent surge in coronavirus cases is starting to drag on economic activity. \"You can\\'t dial up a worse situation for value stocks than the biggest collapse ever in a quarter in the post-war history of the United States. That\\'s got to be the worst possible environment for value stocks,\" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. But in a note to clients on Wednesday, Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: )\\'s head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, pointed out that the relative valuation between growth and value has become increasingly stretched, and the firm prefers value stocks for at least the next few months.

Some cyclical stocks, many of which fall into the value bucket, have already outperformed since the March low. The S&P materials sector ( ) is up 57%, energy ( ) is up 52% and industrials ( ) are up nearly 48% to outpace the broad S&P 500\\'s 45% run off the low.

Investors will be looking at Washington for more news about another relief package as the coronavirus enters a new phase. Economic data centers around the ISM manufacturing release Monday, ahead of Friday’s key employment report. Here’s what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, August 3rd. Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok has become the latest flashpoint in the deteriorating relationship between the globe’s two economic superpowers, the U.S. and China. However, Microsoft could have the answer to this particular problem after the U.S. tech giant confirmed that it is holding talks with the app’s owner Bytedance over purchasing the app’s U.S. operations. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella had a conversation with President Donald Trump about the acquisition on Sunday, the tech firm said, and Reuters reported Monday the president has now allowed Microsoft 45 days to negotiate a deal. A successful bid by Microsoft for the popular app would immediately make it a major competitor to social media giants like Facebook (NASDAQ: ) and Snapchat. Trump had previously vowed to ban the app, with the U.S. administration stating that it poses a national security risk because of the personal data it handles. This follows the hard-line stance the U.S. has taken over Chinese companies that it feels contain critical technology. Short-form video app TikTok is thought to have about half a billion active users worldwide - and about 80 million in the U.S. - with a huge proportion of these in their teens or early 20s. Banning the app could alienate many of these young TikTok users ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, an election which is likely to be tightly fought. Coronavirus cases continued to surge in parts of the U.S., with July being the worst month for new cases since the pandemic began. Additionally, White House coronavirus experts warned Sunday that the country is in a new phase of the outbreak. \"We are in a new phase,\" said Dr. Deborah Birx. \"What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread\" in rural as well as urban areas. \"To everybody who lives in a rural area: You are not immune or protected from this virus,\" Birx said.\\xa0 The virus has already claimed over 150,000 lives in the U.S., by far the highest death toll in the world, plus more than a half-million others around the globe. With this in mind, investors will be keeping their eyes on Washington where Congress is still deadlocked over the next round of economic relief from the pandemic. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Sunday he was not optimistic on reaching agreement soon on a deal for the next round of legislation.\\xa0 On Friday tens of millions of Americans lost a $600 per week federal unemployment supplement. U.S. stock markets are seen largely unchanged Monday, with the Nasdaq index set to outperform on the back of strong earnings from the tech giants last week. News out of Washington (see above) and the ongoing earnings season will be key factors this week, ahead of Friday’s official employment report. By 6:30 AM (1030 GMT), the   contract was up 20 points or 0.1%, while the   contract was up 0.3% and the   contract was 0.7% higher. These cash indexes had a strong July. The   gained 2.4%, the   5.5%, its best July in 10 years, and the   rose 6.8%. The week ahead brings another packed slate of earnings, with 130 members of the S&P 500 set to report. Monday sees   (NYSE: ) and Clorox (NYSE: ) report before the opening bell, and Virgin Galactic (NYSE: ) after the close. “To date, 63% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q2 2020,” said John Butters at Factset, in a note to clients. “In terms of earnings, the percentage of companies reporting actual EPS above estimates (84%) is above the five-year average. If 84% is the final percentage for the quarter, it will mark the highest percentage of S&P 500 companies reporting a positive EPS surprise since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008.” The  on Friday will be the key economic release this week, but ahead of that comes the Institute for Supply Management’s  , due at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT).\\xa0 This is expected to show a small rebound to 53.6 in July, from 52.6 the previous month, suggesting this part of the economy remains in expansion territory, although the containment measures which were reintroduced in some states in the second half of the month could create a negative surprise. Earlier Monday, manufacturing activity across the euro zone expanded for the first time since early 2019, with IHS Markit\\'s final   bouncing to 51.8 in July from June\\'s 47.4. The news was also positive in Asia, as China’s private   increased to 52.8 from 51.2 the prior month, its highest level since January 2011. On Friday, China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index rose in July to 51.1 from 50.9 a month earlier, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\\xa0 The U.S.  had a bad July, suffering its largest monthly fall in three years.\\xa0 Traders have been fretting about the explosion of coronavirus cases across America, amid fears an ineffectual response could result in lasting damage to the U.S. economy that could keep interest rates and growth low for years. “This is not the benign dollar decline we had envisaged, but instead, one seemingly being driven on a new risk premium being inserted into U.S. asset markets on the back of a resurgence in US Covid-19 cases,” said analysts at ING, in a research note. This has resulted in a soaring price for  , which moved up more than 9% in the month of July to all-time highs. The yellow metal is denominated in dollars and thus cheaper for investors outside of the U.S., as well as being seen as a store of value during geopolitical uncertainty.

Economic data released on Thursday painted a mixed picture as U.S. Labor Department numbers showed a first fall in jobless claims in three weeks, although a separate report showed a 54% surge in job cuts announced by employers in July. The data comes ahead of the government payrolls report on Friday. Investors are looking to the next fiscal aid package to further cope with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday Republicans and Democrats remained far apart over what to include in another wave of relief. Senate Republicans have been told that negotiators have until Friday to reach agreement. \"If there\\'s not a deal by Friday, there won\\'t be a deal,\" Republican Senator Roy Blunt told reporters on Wednesday. \"I’m not sure people are taking the drop dead date seriously because most people probably view that as a negotiating ploy and people realize the government is going to have to do something,\" said Bruno.

As major averages continue to rally off their March lows, powered by heaps of fiscal and monetary stimulus and better-than-feared second-quarter earnings, the Dow and S&P notched their fifth straight daily gain, with the Nasdaq climbing for a seventh consecutive session.  The corporate results season is now in its final stretch, with about 424 S&P 500 firms having reported so far.

Surging U.S. stocks, Treasuries and gold prices have come to the brink of simultaneously notching record highs for the first time in history, while rallies in once beaten-down assets like oil, financial stocks and the euro have accelerated. The S&P 500 is up 50% from its late March lows. \"We are in the \\'bull everything\\' trade,\" said Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners. \"There are very few losers. Only laggards.\" The broad-based gains have presented investors with a conundrum. While many are uneasy owning assets that appear richly valued or trade at record highs, holding too much cash or an outsize allocation to underperforming stocks has hampered portfolio performance during the recent rally.  Another concern is the possibility of a broad reversal where assets that appreciated in tandem sell off simultaneously, leaving investors with few places to shelter.  Such market action was seen at various times during the coronavirus-fueled sell-off in March, when gold, stocks and Treasuries tumbled together as frightened investors went to cash. STAYING THE COURSE Plenty of investors believe the rallies are likely to continue as long as interest rates remain low and the Federal Reserve keeps pumping out stimulus - factors that have benefited everything from technology-related stocks to commodities such as oil and gold.  And while some investors worry that the S&P 500 ( ) has become increasingly skewed towards technology ( ) and communication services ( ) - which make up about 39% of the benchmark index\\'s market capitalization - these sectors also accounted for about 39% of the index\\'s second-quarter earnings, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. \"We still like businesses that are tech-focused and creating efficiencies in a post-COVID world,\" said Conor Delaney, chief executive of financial advisory network Good Life Companies.  Among his holdings are shares of   Inc (O: ), a bet that the shift to work-from-home prompted by the coronavirus is unlikely to reverse anytime soon.  Meanwhile, a 9% decline in the Dollar Index ( ) from its high this year has given another tailwind to gold  George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management, has periodically advised clients to raise allocations in the haven metal to hedge against everything from political uncertainty to a future surge in inflation.  \"We are staying the course,\" he said. \"I believe gold goes higher.\" GETTING OUT Others believe the answer is to sell now and wait for things to get cheaper.  Analysts at BofA Global Research noted that August kicks off what has historically been the weakest three-month stretch of the year for equities, where the average historic return stands at about 0%, according to the bank\\'s data.  Investors pulled a net $6.5 billion out of U.S. equities in the last week, the largest outflows in a month-and-a-half, the bank said.  Persistent buying on dips and wild rallies in the shares of companies \"that make no sense\" have convinced Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea, that markets may be entering a euphoric phase that tends to precede corrections. \"We have been telling our investors they should lighten positions slowly and prudently,\" he said.  Other potential flashpoints for volatility include a reversal of the dollar\\'s downtrend, a worsening coronavirus outbreak or a contested U.S. presidential vote, investors said. THE VALUE OF VALUE Some have shifted their orientation to so-called value stocks, which are concentrated in economically-sensitive sectors that have tended to mount powerful rallies during rebounds from recessions. John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, owns financial ( ) and industrial ( ) stocks alongside technology shares in hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine will spur economic recovery next year. Past rebounds in value names have often come at the expense of momentum stocks, said Solomon Tadesse, head of quantitative equities strategy for North America at Societe Generale (OTC: ). One such move came during a three-month stretch in 2009, when value stocks saw a 25% gain while momentum names lost about 30%, Tadesse said. \"It\\'s a short window and if you miss it, you miss it,\" he said.

The   is 1.1% below its closing high in February as investors head into the July   report at 8:30 a.m. New York time Friday. The data is crucial after a five-day rally that has looked past escalating U.S.-China tensions and instead toward the economic rebound, strong earnings and chances that Congress will approve a new stimulus plan. The report is “one of the more consequential NFP releases in recent memory and represents a critical update on the state of the labor market recovery,” said Ian Lyngen, a strategist at BMO Capital Markets. The biggest economy is expected to have added almost 1.5 million jobs in July, with the unemployment rate dropping to 10.6% from a prior 11.1% and average hourly earnings declining 0.5%, according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg News. Here’s what some strategists see for markets around the report: Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Results of BMO’s pre-payrolls survey “suggest a degree of downside is already reflected” in Treasury yields, “which raises the bar for any weakness in Friday’s number to truly shock investors. This does not preclude a robust report from inspiring a sell-off, but we suspect that would only further cement the trading range.” “46% see a retest of 3,000 in the S&P 500 before reaching 3,600, while 54% anticipate an extension of the bullishness in equities to reach that threshold before any revisit to 3,000,” Lyngen said about the split in responses in the survey. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific Pte. “With stocks enjoying a multi-day rally, and the dollar under a constant artillery barrage all week, the risks are that a disappointing number and or a massive downward revision to last month, sets of a potentially ugly short-term correction. That could see the U.S. dollar jump, stocks retreat and also knock gold off its record-highs perch. An aggressive fall by U.S. stocks would be a stern test for gold, as recent times suggest the two have a high correlation in such circumstances.” Shawn Quigg, strategists at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) & Co. “With an extended unemployment package still in debate, it could weigh on economic optimism” and fuel market moves around the jobs report. In particular, “energy stocks continue to be volatile around important economic releases given the perceived importance to a continued economic recovery.” The strategists recommend buying straddles on the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF and Ford Motor (NYSE: ) Co. shares, and selling straddles on   (NASDAQ: )., ahead of the report. Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network Expectations for a strong jobs data “could be low considering how weak the ADP report was earlier this week. The ADP report is not always a great leading indicator for the employment report but we’ll see if there is a higher correlation this month. If the number surprises on the downside and the unemployment rate doesn’t dip below 11% then we could see a market pullback on the news.” Add a Comment'], ['By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment growth slowed considerably in July amid a resurgence in new COVID-19 infections, offering the clearest evidence yet that the economy\\'s recovery from the recession caused by the pandemic was faltering. The Labor Department\\'s closely watched employment report on Friday piles pressure on the White House and Congress to reach an agreement on another aid package. Talks have been dragging over differences on major issues including the size of a government benefit for tens of millions of unemployed workers. A $600 weekly unemployment benefit supplement expired last Friday, while thousands of businesses have burned through loans offered by the government to help with wages. \"The jobs recovery is on very shaky ground and without seat belts for the unemployed provided by additional fiscal stimulus the economy could be in for a very bumpy ride,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. \"There cannot be sustainable economic growth if the country has to carry on with the crushing weight of massive unemployment.\"  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 1.763 million jobs last month after a record rise of 4.791 million in June. That left payrolls 12.9 million below their pre-pandemic level. Employment peaked at 152.5 million in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 1.6 million jobs were added in July. Many say July was probably the last month of employment gains related to the rehiring of workers after the reopening of businesses. The slowing labor market is more bad news for President Donald Trump, who is lagging in opinion polls behind former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee for the Nov. 3 election.  The economy, which entered into recession in February, suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years.  Infections of the respiratory illness soared across the country last month, forcing authorities in some of the worst-affected areas in the West and South to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings, sending workers back home. Demand for goods and services has suffered. Last month\\'s slowdown in job growth occurred across all sectors, with the exception of government. The leisure and hospitality industry hired 592,000 workers, accounting for about a third of nonfarm payrolls. The bulk of the jobs were at restaurants and bars. Retail employment rose by 258,000 jobs, with almost half of the gain in clothing and accessories stores.  Professional and business services added 170,000 jobs, concentrated in the temporary help services. Government employment increased by 301,000 in July, artificially boosted by hefty gains in state and local government education. The model that the government uses to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data normally anticipates education workers to drop off payrolls in July. This, however, happened earlier because of the pandemic, leading to a big gain in July. U.S. stocks opened lower while the dollar ( ) rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading largely higher. MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED The unemployment rate fell to 10.2% from 11.1% in June, but it has been biased downward by people misclassifying themselves as being \"employed but absent from work.\"  The Labor Department\\'s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the report, estimated that the jobless rate would have been 11.2% without this error. The BLS, however, cautioned that the 1 percentage point estimate \"represents the upper bound of our estimate of misclassification and probably overstates the size of the misclassification error.\" At least 31.3 million people were receiving unemployment checks in mid-July. The slowdown in hiring challenges the U.S. stock market\\'s expectation of a V-shaped recovery. The S&P 500 index ( ) is up nearly 50% from its March trough. As COVID-19 cases spiral, and Republicans and Democrats bicker over another stimulus package, economists see a W-shaped recovery. Economists estimate the Paycheck Protection Program that gave businesses loans that can be partially forgiven if used for employee pay saved around 1.3 million jobs at its peak. The extra $600 weekly unemployment checks made up 20% of personal income and helped to boost consumer spending in May and June.

The benchmark index was about half a percent below the all-time high it hit on Feb. 19, when investors started dumping shares in anticipation of what proved to be the biggest slump in the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. Ultra-low interest rates, trillions of dollars in stimulus and, more recently, a better-than-feared second-quarter earnings season have allowed all three of Wall Street\\'s main indexes to recover.

Aiding sentiment, President Vladimir Putin claimed Russia had become the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to a COVID-19 vaccine. But the approval has concerned some experts as the vaccine still must complete final trials. Investors are now hoping Republicans and Democrats will resolve their differences and agree on another relief program to support about 30 million unemployed Americans, as the battle with the virus outbreak was far from over with U.S. cases surpassing 5 million last week. \"The probability that fiscal and monetary stimulus will bridge the gap for the U.S. economy to reopen is going up, and that\\'s what markets like,\" said Tim Shaler, chief economist for iTrustCapital in Newport Beach, California.

Add a Comment'], [\"By Noel Randewich and Munsif Vengattil (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc on Tuesday announced a five-for-one stock split, sending the electric carmaker's recently high-flying shares up 7% in extended trade. Tesla's stock, which traded at $1,475 after the announcement, is among the highest priced on Wall Street, and the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a press release it was looking to make its shares more accessible to employees and investors. Tesla's stock has surged over 200% this year, while shares of General Motors (NYSE: ) and Ford Motor (NYSE: ) declined on fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Stock splits are a way for companies to make shares more accessible to retail investors, potentially attracting individual investors who make small trades. However, brokerages increasingly let customers buy parts of shares, making the benefit of share splits less clear than in the past.  Tesla said stock holders of record on Aug. 21 would receive four additional shares after the close of trading on Aug. 28, with the stock trading on a split-adjusted basis beginning Aug. 31. Tesla's stock split follows a four-for-one split announced by Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ) in late July, the iPhone maker's first stock split since 2014. Stock splits have become rare on Wall Street in recent years, with just three S&P 500 components announcing splits in 2020, compared with an average of 10 a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Tesla in July posted a second-quarter profit as cost cuts and strong deliveries helped offset coronavirus-related factory shutdowns, clearing a hurdle that could lead to the carmaker's inclusion in the S&P 500 index. While many institutional investors have avoided Tesla's stock in recent years due to a lack of consistent profitability, the company has a strong following among individual investors. Over the past 30 days, Tesla was second only to Apple as the most popular stock on the Robinhood trading app, according to Robintrack, a website that tracks Robinhood holdings.  Tesla's stock split should not affect S&P Dow Jones Indices' potential decision to add the company to the S&P 500, which is weighted by companies' overall stock market values. The share split will not make Tesla any less expensive in terms of actual earnings it delivers to investors. The stock currently trades at 112 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to Refinitiv. By comparison, GM is valued at eight times expected earnings, and Ford at 45 times expected earnings.

That followed Tuesday's report showing that producer prices, too, rose by 0.6% last month. The figures gave extra support to cyclical stocks, which were already enjoying a lift from strengthening hopes for a vaccine that will suppress the fear of Covid-19 and allow consumers to return to normal lives more quickly than previously expected.

Shares in the electric carmaker rose more than 6% in early trading. The stock, which traded at around $1,467 before the bell on Wednesday, is among the highest priced on Wall Street. The five-for-one split - Tesla\\'s first - comes at a time when analysts and investors have expressed concerns over the stock\\'s high valuation in the market despite cash burn concerns. \"The move makes sense for Tesla, as it will make its shares cheaper and more accessible to young first-time retail traders using platforms like Robinhood,\" said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. \"While stock splits are typically non-events for investors, the reaction seen in Tesla\\'s stock following the announcement underlines the surging demand from the Robinhood-retail traders to get in on fast-growing tech names.\" Tesla\\'s move follows a four-for-one split announced by Apple Inc (O: ) in late July, the iPhone maker\\'s first stock split since 2014. \"We believe institutional investors have turned the corner in a positive direction as Musk & Co. have not just talked the talk but walked the walk on its Model 3 sales and profitability trajectory over the last year despite COVID,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said.

The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday, however, probably does not mark the start of worrisome inflation, and the Federal Reserve is likely to continue pumping money into the economy to aid the recovery from the COVID-19 recession.  The jump in prices is likely an unwinding of sharp declines experienced when nonessential businesses were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The higher prices further dispel fears of deflation, a decline in the general price level that is harmful during a recession as consumers and businesses may delay purchases in anticipation of lower prices. \"This should end any speculation that the pandemic-related slump in demand will quickly push the economy into a deflationary spiral,\" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. \"But this is not a sign that the U.S. is instead about to experience a bout of much high inflation because of supply restrictions.\"  The consumer price index rose 0.6% last month, with gasoline accounting for a quarter of the gain. The CPI increased by the same margin in June. In the 12 months through July, the CPI accelerated 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in June.  Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI jumped 0.6% last month as the cost of motor vehicle insurance surged a record 9.3%. That was the largest gain in the so-called core CPI since January 1991 and followed a 0.2% rise in June. In the 12 months through July, the core CPI advanced 1.6% after increasing 1.2% in June. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would rise 0.3% in July and the core CPI would gain 0.2%. The report followed on the heels of news on Tuesday that producer prices accelerated in July.  With at last 31.3 million people on unemployment benefits, inflation is hardly a threat in the services-oriented economy. \"The biggest input to service sector prices is labor, and when you have more that 30 million people claiming unemployment benefits there is likely to be a glut for quite a while,\" said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING in New York. \"This will keep wage pressure subdued, thus limiting the upside for service sector inflation.\" The Fed tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for its 2% inflation target. The core PCE price index rose 0.9% on a year-on-year basis in June. Economists expect July data, which will be released later this month, will show the core PCE price index rose about 1.4%. The U.S. central bank has adopted an extraordinarily easy monetary policy, slashing interest rates to near zero as well as making large-scale asset purchases and funneling loans to firms among other measures. But the budding recovery from the pandemic is showing signs of stress as new coronavirus infections spiral across the United States, forcing authorities in some of the hot spots to either shut down businesses again or pause reopenings. Job growth slowed significantly in July. The economy, which entered recession in February, suffered its biggest blow since the Great Depression in the second quarter, with gross domestic product dropping at its steepest pace in at least 73 years. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 ( ) index edging toward a record high. The dollar ( ) fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were trading mostly lower. FOOD PRICE RELIEF In July, gasoline prices advanced 5.6% after soaring 12.3% in June. Food prices fell 0.4%, the first decrease since April 2019, after rising 0.6% in June. The cost of food consumed at home dropped 1.1%, with beef prices tumbling 8.2% after surging in recent months. But the cost of food consumed away from home rose 0.5%, with full-service meals increasing 0.4%.  Owners\\' equivalent rent of primary residence, which is what a homeowner would pay to rent or receive from renting a home, rose 0.2%. That followed June\\'s 0.1% gain, the smallest rise since July 2013. Many tenants have entered into forbearance agreements with landlords.  Consumers also paid more for healthcare in July, with prices rising 0.4%. The cost of doctor visits increased 0.7% and prices for hospital services rose 0.2%. The cost of prescription medication, however, fell 0.2%. Prices for wireless telephone services rose 3.6%. Prices of used cars and trucks increased 2.3% after three straight monthly declines. The cost of airline fares jumped 5.4%, the biggest rise since July 1999. Prices for hotel and motel accommodation increased 1.3%. New motor vehicles prices gained 0.8% and those of apparel advanced 1.1%. There were also increases in the prices of household furnishings, recreation, personal care products and services. \"The weakness in rents is arguably more indicative for longer-term inflation trends than the rebounds in travel and core goods, and the weakness is more likely to persist\" said Oscar Munoz, macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.

The benchmark S&P 500 rose as high as 3,387.24 during the session, just above its record high closing level of 3,386.15 from Feb. 19. The record came just before investors sold shares in anticipation of what proved to be the biggest slump in the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. The index\\'s intraday record high of 3,393.52 was also set on Feb. 19.  An 11.2% slump in shares of Cisco Systems weighed on the Dow and S&P 500 after the company forecast first-quarter revenue and profit below estimates. Concern about corporate earnings has continued despite a mostly stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit season. \"The outlook for earnings in the next few quarters seems to be getting watered down by a lot of big companies,\" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. \"It\\'s making for a sluggish market without a real catalyst to push it up and over the hurdle for good,\" he said, referring to the S&P 500\\'s record. Apple Inc (O: ) shares rose 1.8%, helping to support the Nasdaq and limiting losses in the S&P 500. Also limiting bearishness, jobless claims fell below 1 million for the first time since efforts to curb the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States began five months ago. Wall Street has recovered most of the trillions in market capitalization lost during the start of the pandemic and the Nasdaq was the first of the three major indexes to hit a record high in June. The Dow remains below its February peak.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased to 963,000 for the week ended Aug. 8, the lowest level since mid-March. But the expiration of a $600 weekly jobless supplement at the end of July likely contributed to the decline. Data last week showed the economy had regained only 9.3 million of the 22 million jobs lost between February and April, indicating a long road to reach pre-pandemic levels. Investors continue to hold on to hopes Democrats and the White House can reach agreement on a stimulus package to help the economy recover.

Current and former U.S. government officials and trade experts in both countries say the Phase 1 deal, signed in January after nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs and angry rhetoric, is the one area where the world\\'s two largest economies are still cooperating.  The Trump administration has sanctioned companies and individuals linked to a security crackdown in Hong Kong and human rights, banned a Chinese owned video app, penalized Chinese academics and closed Beijing\\'s consulate in Houston in recent months.  Beijing has responded by closing the U.S. consulate in Chengdu and sanctioning some members of Congress. Despite the escalating conflict, the Phase 1 trade deal won\\'t be dismantled, U.S. officials say.  \"They have said they intend to implement the plan and we are engaged with them,\" White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Thursday. \"We have big differences with China on other matters, but regarding the Phase 1 trade deal, we are engaging.\"  Chinese trade advisors say the slowing of both economies because of coronavirus-related lockdowns has made it difficult to meet purchase targets, but they don\\'t expect the White House to walk away.  \"Being able to sit down and communicate with each other is a good thing,\" said a Chinese state think tank economist who has advised Beijing on the trade deal, while cautioning there was little optimism about further trade breakthroughs. \"It\\'s hard for things to get even worse, while a best case scenario is hard to achieve,\" said the economist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"How can flowers grow in such a bad environment?\" China is falling far short of a promised additional $77 billion in purchases of U.S. farm and manufactured products, energy and services, although it has ramped up purchases of U.S. farm goods including soybeans and corn in recent weeks.  Imports of farm goods have been lower than 2017 levels, far behind the 50% increase needed to meet the 2020 target of $36.5 billion.  Beijing has bought only 5% of the energy products needed to meet the Phase 1 first year goal of $25.3 billion. How to close or explain away this gap will be the biggest challenge for U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He during Saturday\\'s video call.   (NYSE: ) OF A BAD SITUATION  Trade experts said there is little political upside for U.S. President Donald Trump to abandon the deal at this stage, which would admit one of his biggest trade initiatives - already being hammered by Democratic rival Joe Biden - had failed. And even some Trump administration officials have been wary of reigniting a tariff war that would roil markets and likely knock down the S&P 500 ( ), which traded close to record highs this week.  \"At the moment, the agreement serves the interests of the Trump administration and Chinese leaders,\" said former acting USTR Miriam Sapiro, now a managing director at communications firm Sard Verbinnen, adding the requirements set in the deal were \"never realistic.\"  Trump, who has said the trade deal no longer means as much to him because of China\\'s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, has expressed support for the deal this week, saying it should continue and purchases should surge in 2021.. Stephen Vaughn, former USTR general counsel and a legal architect of punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, said compliance with the deal also benefits China by keeping its U.S. relationship from deteriorating further. Now that its economy is recovering strongly from the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing has little excuse not to ramp up its purchases, he added.  \"I don\\'t see what China would gain from a failure to comply.\\xa0My guess is that will not happen,\" said Vaughn, a trade partner with the King and Spalding law firm in Washington.  Claire Reade, a former USTR official and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the agreement does offer some incremental progress for U.S. firms seeking access to the lucrative Chinese market. \"If the administration lets the Phase 1 deal die, it becomes difficult to justify the pain caused by the lengthy trade war,\" she wrote in an essay this week. Nearly 90% of firms surveyed by the U.S.-China Business Council have a positive view of the trade deal, but only 7% say its benefits outweigh the costs of tariffs incurred along the way.

The S&P 500's ( ) record closing high on Tuesday confirmed that the coronavirus-fueled bear market of 2020 was by far the shortest ever.  Measured from the benchmark's previous record high on Feb. 19 to its trough on March 23, the pandemic-induced bear market lasted a mere 33 days, compared to the median age of 302 days of 20 bear markets going back to the 1920s, according to Yardeni Research data.

Wall Street's dramatic bounce over the next five months saw the S&P gain some about 55% in the face of widespread economic devastation and a resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic in parts of the United States.  In June, the Nasdaq became the first of the three major U.S. stock indexes to reclaim all-time highs, powered by gains in the shares of big technology-related companies that prospered during COVID-19 lockdowns, including Amazon.com Inc (O: ) and Netflix Inc (O: ).  Commonly defined as a drop of 20% or more from a peak, the S&P 500 has seen about a dozen bear markets, or near-bear markets since the late 1960s, in most cases accompanied by a recession.

At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT),   traded 6 points, or 0.2%, higher, the   contract rose 56 points, or 0.2%, while   gained 14 points, or 0.1%. At the close Tuesday, the   declined 0.2%, while the  added 0.2%, closing at an all-time peak, and the   index added 0.7%, its 18th record closing high since early June. The closely-watched S&P 500 index has made up all the losses seen when the\\xa0 onset of the Covid-19 pandemic drove the benchmark index to lows on March 23. This has taken just 126 days, the fastest ever recovery from a bear market. Driving this recovery has been the Federal Reserve's intervention in financial markets to maintain liquidity in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as cutting interest rates to near zero. With this in mind, investors will pay close attention to   from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting, due later in the day, for how the central bank sees the economic recovery and for clues over future action at its next meeting. Additionally, hopes are rising that there could be a deal on a scaled-down stimulus package from Congress, after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that Democrats could reduce their proposal to reach a consensus with Republicans.\\xa0 The retail sector will remain in the spotlight, after strong numbers from   (NYSE: ) and Walmart (NYSE: ) Tuesday. Both Lowe’s (NYSE: ) and   (NYSE: ) continued the positive trend, with strong second-quarter comparable sales increases. TJX (NYSE: ) is also due to report earnings Wednesday.

The company had talked up the identification of an antibody that it claimed provided a 100% reliable defense against the Covid-19 virus back in May, only two months after warning that it was running out of cash. Sorrento has attracted the interest of more than one short-seller due to doubts about its governance, but still has a market value of nearly $3 billion. Movements in most stocks were kept within limits by the expected release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting at 2 PM ET, which comes against the backdrop of increased speculation that the Fed will adjust its inflation strategy in such a way as to keep interest rates lower for longer. \\xa0 Add a Comment\"], [\"Investing.com - Synopsys (NASDAQ: ) reported on Wednesday third quarter   that beat analysts' forecasts and revenue that topped expectations.

The Cboe Volatility Index ( ), known as Wall Street\\'s \"fear gauge,\" is near its lowest level since late February and options markets are showing diminishing concerns of a near-term drop in equities.  The S&P 500\\'s ( ) run to fresh highs has come as some of Wall Street\\'s biggest banks, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), UBS Global Wealth Management and   (NYSE: ), turn more bullish on stocks and are urging clients to remain exposed to equities. The index ended at a record high on Tuesday, confirming a bull market, according to one definition.  Investors may well heed their advice: nearly 80% of fund managers surveyed by BofA Global Research, the highest level in more than a decade, expect the global economy to grow over the next year. The survey also showed falling allocations to cash, another sign of increasing bullishness.  The growing optimism is in contrast to the fear and gloom that prevailed on Wall Street only months ago, after the S&P 500 plunged 34% in just 23 trading days and the economy entered a recession that would turn out to be its worst since the Great Depression. Although financial pain remains acute for many Americans, monetary support from the Federal Reserve and expectations for advances in fighting the coronavirus pandemic have made investors more confident in betting on the future, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE: ). \"You have a market that sees that we\\'re getting closer and closer to a more normal world,\" she said. Options markets are among the areas reflecting fading investor worries. Demand for protection against drops in U.S. equities of 30% or more has fallen as volatility has eased in recent months, said Paul Sandhu, BNP Paribas (OTC: ) Asset Management\\'s head of multi-assets quant solutions in the Asia-Pacific region. \"The fear has definitely lessened over the (past) couple of months,\" he said.  Meanwhile, selling of protective put options in individual stocks is up over the past week, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. Put sellers profit if the underlying stock does not drop to a specified level.  The put selling suggests investors are less worried about the downside, Murphy said.  In futures markets, net long equity positioning is now at its highest level since early March, with increases in both large-cap and small-cap stocks,   (DE: ) data showed. The increasingly bullish positioning dovetails with the messages coming from big Wall Street banks. Goldman Sachs, for instance, raised its year-end target for the S&P 500 earlier this week to 3,600 from 3,000, citing expectations for outsized growth in U.S. corporate earnings and gross domestic product next year.  Stocks have dipped since Tuesday, but several market strategists said they saw the pullback as routine rather than a sign that equities had been overbought. Yet there are plenty of reasons for investors to be nervous and some remain skeptical of buying near all-time highs.  One concern is the potential of market volatility stemming from delayed or contested results in November\\'s U.S. presidential election. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) fell 5% in two weeks on the heels of a vote recount in the 2000 presidential election, UBS noted.  Other risks include a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, delays in a vaccine or delays by lawmakers in providing more stimulus to the still-ailing economy. Some of that uncertainty has been reflected in the price of gold, a popular haven that has climbed to record highs this month. Prices recently got an additional boost after   (N: ) disclosed a stake in   (TO: ). Still, some investors believe the prospect of economic recovery now outweighs those risks. Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services, is maintaining an overweight position in U.S. equities. \"We\\'re not taking anything off the table,\" he said. \"We\\'re staying with the primary trend, which is still higher.\"      Add a Comment'], ['By Peter Nurse\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower at the open Thursday, with investors wary ahead of the latest employment data, the day after the Federal Reserve expressed concerns about the state of the U.S. recovery.

Helping the tone Thursday were comments from the Chinese commerce ministry, stating that the U.S. and China have agreed to meet soon to review the progress of their “phase one” trade deal.

Investors will be looking for indications on how the Fed will try to manage the long-term economic recovery in a speech by Chairman Jay Powell on the opening day of the annual   conference on Thursday. Since the global financial crisis, Fed chiefs have used their keynote speech at the Jackson Hole conference - being held virtually this year for the first time in nearly four decades because of the pandemic - to signal important shifts in monetary policy or the economic outlook. A major question - particularly ahead of the Fed's September policy meeting - is whether the central bank will shift its inflation targets to an average, which would allow inflation to run higher before interest rates are raised. Investors may also be on the lookout for signs that the Fed is looking at additional ways to bolster the economy should Congress fail to deliver a new pandemic relief package.

Equity laggards are about to have their moment. These are just some of the reasons why bulls say U.S. shares will defy doomsayers and go higher. The   closed at a record 3,431.28 on Monday, buoyed by hopes for a coronavirus vaccine and expectations of continuing support from economic stimulus. While the likes of   (NYSE: ) have been among those expressing skepticism about the rally, strategists from   Inc (NYSE: ). to RBC Capital Markets and   Inc (NYSE: ). have raised their year-end targets. Here are some of the reasons why analysts expect more gains: For UBS AG Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele, it’s time for under-performing stocks to catch up with the high-flying megacaps. “Laggards and long-term themes are likely to support the next leg higher,” Haefele wrote in a note Monday. “A large share of recent gains have come from the top six U.S. technology firms. For investors with high exposure to these stocks, we recommend rebalancing into cyclical and value stocks, which have so far lagged.” Standard measures of valuation may not be painting an accurate picture of whether stocks are expensive or cheap, according to Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist Jim Paulsen. He points to the output-gap-adjusted price-earnings ratio, which shows the S&P 500 was cheaper only at the bear-market lows of 1974 and 1982. While the gauge is “hardly scientific,” he says it has produced a superior return profile since World War II. “With the U.S. real output gap currently at a record low, the earnings outlook for U.S. companies is probably far stronger than most currently appreciate,” Paulsen wrote. “And, if this is true, the U.S. stock market may actually be trading at a far more reasonable valuation level than traditional measures suggest.” Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ). technical strategists Stephen Suttmeier and Jordan Young see gains ahead, though they caution that narrowing market breadth can be an issue and is worth watching into September. The S&P 500 would have to breach the 3,285-3,272 level “to suggest the onset of increased volatility that often ushers in the bearish August-October period,” they said, adding that “until then, the tactical pattern favors more upside.” If there’s a “melt-up,” they don’t rule out a move up to 3,700. ©2020 Bloomberg L.P. \\xa0 Add a Comment'], ['Investing.com – U.S. stocks were mixed after the close on Tuesday, as gains in the  ,   and   sectors led shares higher while losses in the  ,   and   sectors led shares lower.

Powell — who will be speaking from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, instead of the typical Jackson Hole, Wyoming, venue for the speech — is expected to make the case for stronger monetary stimulus to help the economy.\\xa0 Investors will be on the lookout for signs that the Fed will find additional ways to bolster the economy should Congress fail to deliver on a new pandemic relief package. A major question — particularly ahead of the Fed's September policy meeting\\xa0 — is whether Powell will favor shifting inflation targets to an average, instead of the long-favored 2% level. Such a shift will allow inflation to run higher before interest rates are raised. It’s a dynamic that could clearly weaken the dollar and boost gold. “The gold trade is back,” said Ed Moya, an analyst at OANDA. “Gold prices are reframing their short-term outlook after a weaker dollar … and as dovish expectations grow for Fed Chair Powell’s speech later in the week.\\xa0 If Fed Chair Powell does not disappoint the doves, gold could quickly look to recapture the $2000 level this week.” Moya said pressure was growing by the day for the U.S. Congress to deliver more fiscal support for the economy, and the Fed was likely to step in to fill the void. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said on Wednesday that a new coronavirus relief bill was unlikely to be approved before September due to wrangling between President Donald Trump and his rivals in Congress. “The longer the wait, the larger the package will end up being,” Moya said. “Gold is about to shine bright again and the necessary consolidation before the climb back toward record high territory could be ending.”\\xa0\\xa0 December gold did dial back from the day’s highs after Comex’s settlement as the dollar recovered some ground it lost.

The policy speech — which otherwise would have been delivered at the Fed’s usual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, venue — said the central bank would attempt an “average inflation target” as it tries to mitigate relatively high unemployment expected for at least a couple of years. Despite this, Powell did not repeat the Fed’s pledge to continue with asset purchases, a refrain he had stuck to for months as the central bank held rates to near-zero while setting aside more than $1 trillion from its own balance sheet to help steer the economy through the pandemic.

Notwithstanding Thursday’s slide, some still saw gold as a buy opportunity. “Recall that historical precedents suggest that following a period of extreme momentum, forward returns tend to be skewed negatively with sharp drawdowns and limited upside, suggesting a consolidation period could last for months and that we could still see a deeper pullback,” TD Securities said. “Looking past these near-term headwinds, however, we expect that the prevailing macro tailwinds will continue to suppress real rates via financial suppression, suggesting that capital will seek shelter in precious metals. This suggests that further weakness in the complex represents a buying opportunity.” Add a Comment'], ['Investing.com – U.S. stocks were mixed after the close on Thursday, as gains in the  ,   and   sectors led shares higher while losses in the  ,   and   sectors led shares lower.

The Cboe Volatility Index ( ) was set for a second week of gains, despite a drop on Friday, even as the benchmark S&P 500 ( ) has climbed nearly 3% for the week. That is a departure from typical activity, in which the VIX falls as stocks rise. Yet steep climbs higher can also contribute to greater volatility. The S&P 500 is on track for nearly a 7% monthly gain, exceeding the expectations priced into options, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. The steady rise in stocks has spurred purchases of upside calls on the benchmark index, which in turn are lifting the VIX. \"Just because (the S&P 500) is up doesn\\'t mean there isn\\'t volatility,\" Murphy said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\\'s remarks regarding the central bank\\'s approach to inflation also likely prompted call buying, said Matt Thompson, managing partner at options firm Thompson Capital Management. The Fed will now aim for 2% inflation on average, so that periods of too-low inflation would likely be followed by an effort to lift inflation moderately above that level. As a result, the central bank is likely to keep rates near zero, thereby supporting equities. \"That gave the green light to put bets on the upside,\" Thompson said. Longer-term, however, downside concerns for the overall market may also keep the VIX bid up. Some investors have pointed to concerns that a narrow group of tech-related stocks such as Apple Inc (O: ) and Amazon.com Inc (O: ) is leading the S&P 500 higher, prompting concerns about any slides in their performance. Moreover, VIX futures <0#VX:> point to elevated volatility expectations around the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3. \"If election volatility stays at that level, you could see the VIX marching higher,\" Murphy said.

Add a Comment'], ['By Greg Roumeliotis, Alden Bentley and Anirban Sen (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T: ) made significant option purchases during the run-up in the U.S. stock market in recent weeks as a way of temporarily investing some proceeds from asset sales, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The trades were revealed just as Wall Street\\'s runaway technology-led rally was faltering. The derivatives purchases could shed light on the Nasdaq ( ) and S&P 500 ( ) rise just two days ago to record highs, which seemed to put the coronavirus sell-off in the rearview mirror.  In August, SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son had announced a new investment management subsidiary that would park excess cash from a massive asset sale program in liquid stocks. In total, SoftBank injected roughly $4 billion building up stakes in Amazon.com Inc (O: ), Netflix Inc (O: ), Tesla Inc (O: ),   (O: ) and Alphabet Inc (O: ), according to regulatory filings. SoftBank bought a roughly equal amount of call options tied to the shares it bought, according to the Wall Street Journal. Investors typically pay premiums to buy call options, which give them access to a much higher amount of shares on paper.  SoftBank\\'s options of $4 billion generated an exposure of about $50 billion, according to the WSJ report.  So far, SoftBank has spent roughly $10 billion buying shares. It has also spent more buying derivatives in U.S. stocks, the sources told Reuters. The Financial Times first reported on these derivative purchases on Friday. But market players were unable to gauge the extent to which Softbank (OTC: )\\'s derivative purchases contributed to recent gains. Nor was there strong evidence that the end of the buying could have triggered the stocks tumble on Thursday and Friday.  Raymond James market strategist Ellis Phifer said the buying by SoftBank would have helped push up shares of tech companies in recent months, although the stocks were benefiting from other trends. The extra demand from SoftBank “would have created a positive feedback loop,” he said.

The latest bet on publicly listed tech stocks represent a departure for SoftBank.  It has been under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management to use this cash to pay down debt and buy back shares, after its attempt to raise a second $100 billion Vision Fund struggled because of the lukewarm investment performance of its predecessor and faltering bets .  SoftBank has been temporarily investing some of the proceeds from the asset sales in the U.S. stock market before returning it to shareholders and paying down debt.  A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment.  Reuters could not immediately determine what options strategy, or combination of put options and call options, SoftBank used. Hedging around the purchase and sale of options can magnify moves in the underlying market.  Call options gain in value when prices rise, while puts rise when prices fall.  Buying options can be a cheaper way of investing in an underlying security than direct purchases. But selling uncovered options can be extremely risky. Options prices are determined by factors such as how far away the strike price is, the time to maturity and how volatile the markets are.  The main indexes on Friday were recoiling from the all-time highs hit midweek. The Nasdaq was on track for its biggest two-day fall since March as investors dumped heavyweight technology stocks, while concerns around a patchy economic recovery also hit the S&P 500 and the blue-chip Dow. \"If SoftBank was selling puts its a very dangerous strategy. The big questions are - the scale of what they were doing and are they selling puts to buy calls - because that\\'s when you get embedded leverage,” said Michael Purves, founder and CEO of Tallbacken Capital.

The Withdrawal Agreement allowed the U.K. to exit the EU on January without forfeiting any of its access rights to the EU market until the end of 2020.

What is more likely is for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday to set U.S. monetary policy, to switch its Treasury purchases toward more long-dated debt to keep long-term yields low, some strategists said. The Fed can increase the assets it holds during times of stress to stimulate the economy, or sell them when the economy is in danger of overheating. It has boosted its balance sheet from $4 trillion to $7 trillion since the coronavirus outbreak. A technology-driven stock rally had lifted the benchmark S&P 500 ( ) 15% since the beginning of July to its peak close on Sept. 2. The Nasdaq Composite index ( ) rose 21% over the same period. However, a brutal sell-off in heavyweight tech stocks pushed the Nasdaq into correction territory on Tuesday, commonly defined as a fall of 10% or more from a recent peak. Since then, the market has partially stabilized. Ajay Rajadhyaksha, head of macro research at   (LON: ) Plc, said it would take another sudden and dramatic fall in markets before the Fed would even consider stepping up its buying. \"The Fed will have no issues with the level of equities at this point,\" said Rajadhyaksha, who is on a committee that advises the U.S. Treasury on debt management and the economy. \"I think that you would need them to fall another 10%, at least, quickly, before the Fed even starts to take notice.\" Gennadiy Goldberg, U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities, also said equity sell-offs would not concern the Fed. \"A few declines after a massive rally is really not going to do it for them. They are looking for signs of instability,\" he said. Some investors were looking for increased Fed buying to support the market. Troy\\xa0Gayeski, co-chief investment officer at\\xa0SkyBridge, an alternative investments firm, said the fact the Fed\\'s balance sheet had remained static for 12 weeks was part of the reason for investor caution. \"Unless we get another round of balance sheet expansion and another re-acceleration of money supply growth then markets are going to be much more two way and volatile,\" he said. The Fed has slowed purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed debt as markets recover from chronic liquidity problems in March, when panic over the coronavirus sent stocks tumbling and resulted in logjams across debt markets. It has bought around $190 billion of these securities in the past month, compared with as much as $125 billion a day during the worst of the panic in March. The Fed has also reduced its average daily corporate bond purchases from around $300 million, when the program was introduced in May, to $26 million last week, as credit spreads have tightened. The Fed last stepped up its corporate debt buying in June, which came after equity market sell-offs and widening investment grade credit spreads. A decline in repo loans that were increased to loosen funding conditions during the market rout has kept the Fed\\'s balance sheet steady at around $7 trillion since May, even as debt purchases continue at lower levels. The Fed has committed to buying at least $120 billion monthly in Treasury and mortgage-backed assets and pledged it would do whatever was needed to ensure liquidity remains in the market.

Markets will also be paying close attention to data on U.S. retail sales for August, out on Wednesday and initial jobless claims figures a day later. Last week’s volatility in stocks could continue with a much-awaited fiscal aid package stalled in the Senate and the election looming. In the UK, the government is to begin debating its controversial internal markets bill which could wreck its EU divorce treaty. Meanwhile, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will both hold policy meetings just hours after the Fed on Thursday. Here is what you need to know to start your week. The Fed, which wraps up its two-day   on Wednesday, is expected to make some minor adjustments to the language in its rate statement after it adopted a new approach last month to meeting its 2% inflation target. The Fed’s decision to tolerate periods of higher inflation effectively means that interest rates will remain lower for longer. The Fed will also update its projections for the economic and interest rate outlook, known as the dot plot, which will include forecasts for 2023 for the first time. \"I think the 2023 dots will be the ones everybody’s staring at,” said Jon Hill, an interest rate strategist at BMO Capital Markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that while the central bank will keep its foot on the monetary policy gas, lawmakers also need to help with recovery relief, making the absence of a new fiscal policy package an increasingly worrying development for some investors. Ahead of the Fed announcement on Wednesday the U.S. is to release data on retail sales for August. The consensus forecast is for an increase of   month-over-month and the data will give an important insight into whether the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits at the end of July hit consumer spending.\\xa0 Market participants will also be watching Thursday’s data on  .

But other investors view the recent slump as a healthy consolidation after a stunning five-month rally in the   that was powered by a small group of heavyweight tech companies and massive amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus.

Longs in gold, meanwhile, are just at a loss. A “mini” 3-day rally in gold came to an abrupt end Friday despite surprisingly supportive European Central Bank policy. And while the yellow metal eked out a modest weekly gain, there are few clues on what it could do through the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, before Chairman Jay Powell’s news conference. While U.S. interest rates themselves won’t be any news next week — with the Fed looking most comfortable with its zero to 0.25% holding rate — Chair Powell will likely revisit the central bank’s mission of higher-for-longer inflation. If he does that, the   should — and I mean, logically, should — trade at the lower 92 levels, giving gold a substantial bid. But little of what the dollar has done over the past month has been logical. Therefore, gold longs will be going into the new week wary, even if a dovish (friendly) Fed and Chair await them. In fact, ECB Chairwoman Christine Lagarde already gave gold bugs an early gift on Friday by refusing to suppress inflation in Europe. That popped the   and briefly hurt the greenback. Yet, the Dollar Index retained its tough 93-handle on the back of friendly U.S. CPI, giving little reprieve to gold. TD Securities was among the cheerleaders for gold as it published a note Friday on prospects for the haven going into the meeting of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee. “We expect next week's FOMC to clear the second hurdle for yellow metal bulls — officials should send a dovish signal through the wording on QE, the extension of the dot plot through 2023, and the Chairman's press conference,” analysts at the Canadian bank-backed brokerage said. “Over time, this will open up the door to an extension in the average maturity of Treasury purchases, which should further support precious metals. In this context, we argue that the trading set-up in precious metals is ripe for a breakout higher.” I’ll take that with more than a few grains of salt, considering what TD Securities also said of gold’s likely benefit after the ECB’s refusal to tamp down eurozone inflation. “The ECB's decision to brush off the exchange rate appreciation has crossed off an important hurdle for gold bugs,” the same analysts wrote. “Signaled by the revised inflation forecast, the bank showed no real concern on the currency pass-through to inflation forecasts, which our FX strategy colleagues argue will allow the market to return to its old impulses and biases: investors will return their focus to the weak USD narrative, on an opportunistic basis,” they added. Really? The Dollar Index gained almost 0.7% for the just-ended week. Meanwhile, spot gold, which tracks real-time trades in bullion, was up just 0.5% on the week. More interestingly, it was the second straight week of gains for the greenback indicator, which rose just over 1% in all since the week ended Aug 21. The bullion barometer, on the other hand, lost a net 0.8% in the same span. In oil, crude bears rejoiced for a second week in a row as higher-than-anticipated crude stockpiles rattled investors already concerned about fuel demand with the end of the peak U.S. driving season. Bloomberg reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies will convene online in the coming week, to reflect on whether the coronavirus has thwarted their best efforts to keep the market afloat. After reviving crude prices from an unprecedented collapse over the spring, the greater OPEC+ alliance — steered by Saudi Arabia and assisted by non-producer members led by Russia — is seeing the recovery for oil stall and fuel demand falter as the deadly pandemic surges once again. Prices slipped below $40 a barrel in the just-ended week, the first time since June. On Thursday, the Saudis and the Russians will chair a monitoring meeting to assess whether the vast production cuts, which they started easing in August, are still staving off an oil glut. New signs of exporters reneging on the deal aren’t helping. And OPEC+ data shows Russia to be among the cheaters. If that’s not enough of a dilemma for the Saudis, renegade Libyan general Khalifa Haftar has committed to ending the North African country’s blockade on oil, meaning even more supply — up to one million barrels per day — could hit the market in due course. Haftar’s move might be good for Libya's civil liberty. But certainly not great news for OPEC and crude right now. Oil prices finished with a second week of losses that left the market down more than 10% over the past fortnight. A sluggish Friday on Wall Street added to the anemic performance in oil. The  , the leading indicator of U.S. stocks, spent much of the day in negative territory before ending flat, after the previous week’s drop of more than 2%.

It did a final post-settlement trade of $39.80. Brent lost 6.6% for the week, adding to the previous week’s drop of 5.3%. The price slide came after the Energy Information Administration reported a weekly   build of 2 million barrels, above the 1.3-million forecast by analysts.

Aside from the weekly crude build, the EIA also reported that refinery utilization of oil fell 5% for a second straight week. That raised concerns about demand for fuel after the end of the peak U.S. summer driving season. On the bearish side as well, the EIA raised output estimates for U.S. crude by 300,000 barrels per day to 10 million bpd, accounting for the redeployment of production platforms on the Gulf Coast of Mexico that were preemptively shut during last month’s Hurricane Laura.

Merger activity within the S&P 500 ( ) has historically been the biggest reason companies leave the index, and could provide an opening for a company like Tesla, said two sources familiar with how the committee has made decisions.  While some in the market have questioned the quality of Tesla\\'s earnings, it was still widely expected to gain entry to the benchmark. \"It will go into the S&P. There\\'s no way it cannot at some point,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. \"Maybe it\\'s in the penalty box right now while they just assess the situation.\"  While Tesla\\'s valuation \"seems absolutely crazy\" the company cannot be ignored, he added.  A spokesman for S&P declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Picking which companies make it in the S&P 500 is part science, part art. There are formal criteria a company is expected to meet, around things like profitability, share float and market capitalization, but the index committee has leeway in deciding who makes the cut.  The S&P 500\\'s aim is not to beat the market, but to emulate the performance of its 11 sectors, as well the 156 sub-industries within those sectors.  Tesla, as an automaker, is part of the consumer discretionary sector, which currently has an 11.4% weighting in the index. That sector also includes companies like retailers, home builders and restaurants. The index committee aims to pick the companies that best represent their industries, while keeping the weighting of the sector in check against the others, which include information technology, health care, and financials, so the index\\'s performance matches that of the overall market, one source said. Mergers among companies in the index give committee members - the names of whom S&P does not make public - additional opportunities to readjust weightings based on the ever-changing dynamic of the market. Tesla\\'s shares, for instance, have skyrocketted more than 300% this year, making it the world\\'s most valuable automaker, and changing the entire sector\\'s footprint. Since the S&P\\'s latest index decision, Tesla stock is down more than 10%.  When Tesla in July reported its fourth-straight quarterly profit, one condition for S&P 500 entry, many investors believed it was destined for admission, helping fuel the rally in the company\\'s shares. But Tesla was not on the list of new additions announced Sept. 4 ahead of the index\\'s quarterly rebalancing on Sept. 18. The committee\\'s decision \"can only have come from a collective and committed view that (Tesla) is profoundly over-valued and sits on shakier fundamentals than its mega market cap indicates,\" said DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas. Still, he said he was \"surprised\" Tesla was not admitted. The omission came as Tesla\\'s latest earnings showed the sale of emissions credits to other carmakers helped make up for losses in its core autos business. At any moment there are 25 to 50 companies that technically qualify to be in the index, but are not in, and a handful of those are companies the committee agrees are acceptable candidates when discussed in its monthly meetings, one source said. With a big name like Tesla, it is tempting to look for a big exit from the index, the person said, adding that the committee tracks announced mergers, which are opportunities to make unscheduled additions.

Housing starts fell for the first time in four months in August, as did building permits, but analysts expect this to be a temporary dip.\\xa0 Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that the drop in housing starts was \"more than accounted for\" by the impact of Hurricane Laura and Tropical Storm Marco, which hit the southern U.S. last month. The drop in building permits, meanwhile, was entirely due to the volatile multi-family segment, whereas permits for single-family homes continued to rise rapidly. \"Further increases in permit issuance are coming, and starts will rebound strongly too,\" Shepherdson said.

The investor closed a position in a bullish call options spread on Adobe Inc (O: ) at a loss of roughly $200,000. The spread represented around $935 million of notional value. The call spread was originally bought on Aug. 5 among a group of trades that some market analysts have attributed to SoftBank Group Corp (T: ). Adobe shares ended 1.4% lower at $467.55 as U.S. stocks fell broadly. The investor sold stock at the time of the call spread purchase, then bought back the shares after selling the options, at a loss of roughly $9 a share.

Add a Comment'], ['(Bloomberg) -- In a month during which the red-hot trade in technology stocks has wavered and options activity dominated headlines, traders are facing another potential catalyst for market turmoil on Friday. Options and futures on indexes and equities are scheduled to expire, a quarterly event known as quadruple witching that typically fuels trading as large derivatives positions roll over. While spikes in volume usually occur around the open and close, providing windows of robust liquidity, large price swings can happen suddenly at any time of the day. The event is getting more attention than usual because options activity from small investors and the so-called Nasdaq whale have been blamed for whipping up turbulence in internet and software shares. Despite an 11% drop in the   from its Sept. 2 peak, open interest on bullish contracts tied to the gauge remains elevated. So was volume in calls linked to shares of tech titans like Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). and   (NASDAQ: ). “If you’re heavily long tech, the quadruple witching is going to be a real fireworks show,” Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Baird, said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Alix Steel. “There is going to be a lot of action.” Quadruple witching can spark some of the busiest trading days of the year. The last event in June saw more than 16 billion shares changing hands, 30% above the average in the previous three months. The expiration event usually coincides with a rebalancing of major indexes such as the   and can spark some of the busiest trading days of the year.This time, index rebalancing alone could force $32.4 billion of trades, S&P Dow Jones estimated. “When you have those expirations, you typically get some more volatility,” said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust in Santa Ana, California. “People need to figure out what to do with them, clear out those positions off their books and potentially re-up for other ones. About 90 million option contracts are set to expire Friday, according to data compiled by Chris Murphy, a derivatives strategist at Susquehanna. While the amount is up from a year ago, it trails the June expiration by roughly 10%. One reason behind the shortfall is the robust use of short-dated options, especially calls sought by day traders to chase market winners, Murphy said. Because these options expire within days or weeks, few are left for quadruple witching. Options contracts with maturities less than two weeks out comprised 75% of all trades in July, a record high, according to data compiled by   Inc (NYSE: ). Another unusual feature this time around is the popularity of single-stock options, particularly bullish wagers, as investors chase stock winners, rather than hedging against broad market losses. At the start of September, single stock call option volumes averaged $335 billion over 10 days, approaching the notional volume traded in index put options for the first time in at least three years, Goldman data shows. That preference is likely to shift in coming months amid macro risks ranging from the U.S. presidential election to the path of economic reopening and trade tensions with China, according to David Silber, head of institutional equity derivatives at Citadel Securities. “There will be an increase in index activity into year-end as people migrate out of single stock risks and focus more on the macro environment and the many events before then,” Silber said. “We can see another large expiration in Q4 closer to the size we saw in Q1, when there was a large demand for March options given the macro uncertainty around Covid.” \\xa0 \\xa0 Add a Comment'], ['Investing.com – U.S. stocks were lower after the close on Friday, as losses in the  ,   and   sectors led shares lower.

California-based Beyond Meat, for which about half of its global sales came from restaurants, has had to reroute its products - plant-based patties, chicken and sausages - to retailers such as Walmart and Costco (O: ), to keep sales humming during coronavirus-led restaurant closures.  \"Following the initial release of our Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties at retailers earlier this year, we heard an enthusiastic and overwhelmingly positive response from consumers who asked for increased availability,\" Chuck Muth, Chief Growth Officer, said.  The company launched the Beyond Breakfast Sausage patty, meant to taste like pork breakfast sausage patties, at select stores in March. The addition of 5,000 more stores will result in doubling of distribution of these products, the company said.  Demand for plant-based meat alternatives has continued to surge during the pandemic with Nielsen data showing that unit sales for fully cooked plant-based alternatives jumped 25% in the four weeks to Aug. 22.

Tesla\\'s stock has recovered in the runup to the event scheduled and it gained 1.4% in early trading on Monday, helped by a leaked email from Musk that said the company was hopeful of racking up record car deliveries in the third quarter.  Many analysts expect Musk to unveil battery improvements extending the Palo Alto, California automaker\\'s lead over General Motors (NYSE: ), Volkswagen (DE: ) and other rivals. Tesla options are pricing in a stock move of around 17% - up or down - by Friday, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.  Tesla\\'s stock has more than made up for a historic slump on Sept. 8 after it was unexpectedly left out of a group companies joining the S&P 500, and it has surged over 400% year to date. Still, Tesla remains below its Aug. 31 record high close. Analysts, including those with neutral ratings on Tesla\\'s stock, expect major advances from Musk. \"We (and the market) expect the announcements to be significant, cementing Tesla\\'s cost and technology lead for several more years,\" UBS analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in a client note on Sept. 11, adding he expects a new dry electrode cell technology to help speed manufacturing and lower costs. Batteries make electric cars cost more than gasoline-powered ones, so the ability to produce low-cost, long-lasting batteries could put Tesla cars on a more equal footing and help usher in mainstream acceptance. Musk in August suggested on Twitter that Tesla may be able to mass produce batteries with 50% more energy density in three to four years, which could even enable electric airplanes. A much hyped \"Autonomy Investor Day\" in April last year failed to stop a five-month decline in the company\\'s stock. At that 2019 event, Musk said that Tesla robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets in 2020, continuing a habit of making bold pronouncements and setting deadlines Tesla does not meet. \"Even if Tesla provides overly ambitious aspirations at Battery Day, we nevertheless expect the event to reinforce Tesla\\'s long-term growth narrative – central to the stock, while also reinforcing investor perception that Tesla is ahead of other automakers,\"   (SIX: ) analyst Dan Levy wrote in a Sept. 16 research note. New battery cell designs, chemistries and manufacturing processes are just some developments that would allow Tesla to reduce its reliance on its long-time battery partner, Japan’s Panasonic (OTC: ).

General Motors (NYSE: ), which had invested $2 billion in an 11% stake in Nikola only two weeks ago, fell 4.5%. Illumina (NASDAQ: ) stock was also down over 5% after the maker of gene sequencing equipment said it will pay $7.1 billion in cash and stock for the shares in Grail that it doesn\\'t already own.

Oracle (NYSE: ) stock was up 1.7% amid conflicting reports about the progress toward resolving TikTok\\'s status in the U.S., while Tesla (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 1.1% after an internal email from CEO Elon Musk said - as he usually does toward the end of a quarter - that the company could break records for deliveries and sales if employees pull together. Tesla is due to hold an event showcasing advances in battery design on Tuesday. Tech stocks more broadly were, however, outperforming, as the weight of selling concentrated itself in cyclical stocks. That was due in part to fears that new U.K. measures to stop the spread of Covid-19 could herald a second wave of lockdowns across the developed world as the northern hemisphere moves into autumn, the time when seasonal flu generally begins to pick up. United Airlines stock was down 8.0% while Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ) stock was down 8.8%.

The pandemic could see dividends fall by over $100 billion this year just in the United States and Europe, analysts tracked by Refinitiv I/B/E/S predict. The global drop may be as big as $400 billion, according to a Janus Henderson report. But futures are pricing worse. These derivatives, which allow punters to take a position on future payouts, imply S&P500 dividends will be 16% below April 2020 levels in 2029. For Europe\\'s STOXX600 ( ), futures price 2028 payouts 18% below 2019 levels. (Graphic: No full recovery from COVID blow in divis for years? - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/nmovawjojva/Pasted%20image%201600454919081.png) \"Investors overall are still a bit cautious on dividends because people question whether or not we\\'ve got to the point of self-sustaining recovery or are we still simply subject to central bank stimulus etc,\" said Matthew Joyce, director of equity strategy at   (LON: ). Central bank stimulus has floored bond yields and fuelled an equity bounce. Yet the longer-term economic and corporate outlook remains uncertain. Joyce reckons dividends may recover by 2022-2023, noting that futures pricing is at a heavy discount to a closely watched dividend index produced by IHS Markit. This forecasts European dividends 13% below pre-COVID levels in 2022, versus the 30% drop futures are pricing. It projects S&P 500 ( ) payouts will return to 2019 levels next year. So why the disconnect? And which is right? Dividends did take four years to fully recover from the 2008-9 crisis so a decade may not seem too much of a stretch. But futures can be skewed by hedging as investors insure themselves against longer-term payment shortfalls. (Graphic: 12M forward dividends for Europe, U.S. - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/buzz/yxmvjblygvr/Pasted%20image%201600454345746.png) \"For people who trade dividend futures, it\\'s hard to see beyond the pandemic,\" said Erik Norland, senior economist at the CME Group (NASDAQ: ). \"It may not be until 2021 that people look into the other side and price in scenarios on what the rest of the decade is going to look like.\" But it may prove challenging to match the 2010-2019 period when payouts rocketed by a record 155%. That compares with 40% growth in each of the preceding two decades, Norland said, pointing to big budget deficits which governments could address by upping corporate taxes. What seems clear though is that S&P500 dividends will bounce back well before Europe which is dominated by banks and commodity firms rather than cash-rich technology firms. Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, predicts next year to be a record for U.S. payouts. \"We have gone through the (dividend) storm,\" he added. \\xa0 Add a Comment'], ['By Yasin Ebrahim Investing.com – The Dow ended higher Tuesday as gains in technology helped the broader market shake off weakness from financials and worries over a second wave of Covid-19.

The Nasdaq and S&P 500 fell more than 2%, and all 11 of the major S&P sectors closed lower. Energy ( ) - already the worst-performing sector this year - led the decline. Hopes of a strong recovery and historic stimulus fueled the U.S. stock rally following the coronavirus-driven crash in March. But doubts over another relief bill and a sell-off in heavyweight technology-related stocks have weighed on sentiment since the market peaked on Sept. 2.

With the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ( ) down more than 13% after a record 84% rally off March lows -- in correction territory -- many investors are speculating that a reversal could pick up speed as a COVID-19 vaccine gets closer. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ), for example, predicts at least one vaccine will be approved by the end of this year. That should help broader markets but weaken the case for shares in companies that benefit when people are forced to stay home, whether cloud computing or e-commerce. But exchange-traded funds, which accounted for most of this year\\'s tech sector inflows, may be the ones to watch. In the week ending Sept. 23, tech-focused ETFs suffered $1.23 billion worth of outflows, the largest since December 2018, when global stock markets tanked, according to Lipper data. September is also the first month of outflows for the tech sector since the COVID-fuelled market selloff in March.  (Graphic: Peak tech - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqnajzpx/Peak%20tech.png) The figures are significant because ETFs such as the Invesco QQQ ETF tracking the Nasdaq have taken some $20 billion between January and July, according to Reuters calculations based on data from Refinitiv and Wisdom Tree. The other reason to watch ETFs is that flows data is available faster compared with mutual funds. \"We think the latest pullback in U.S. equities, from frothy levels, is a chance for investors to diversify their allocation to those parts of the equity market so far left behind, which could benefit Europe,\" said Maneesh Deshpande, a U.S. equity strategist at   (LON: ). For instance, the QQQ fund posted record $3.5 billion outflows on Monday amid a Nasdaq slump, then got $4 billion the following day as sentiment recovered, notes Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. He said the QQQ volatility pointed to \"widespread speculation in U.S. technology stocks and that this is increasingly becoming the leading index for sentiment.\" Data from other ETF service providers also show outflows. On a three-month rolling basis, the most active ETFs tracking the U.S. technology and growth sectors saw $1.7 billion of outflows, the first negative reading this year, according to Wisdom Tree. Making up around a third of the benchmark S&P 500 index ( ), U.S. tech stocks have been the ultimate pandemic beneficiaries, especially so-called FANGMAN - Facebook (NASDAQ: ), Apple (NASDAQ: ), Netflix (NASDAQ: ), Google (NASDAQ: ) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ).

Total net assets for a group of technology focused ETFS nearly doubled to $113 billion at the end of August from $64 billion a year ago, according to Morningstar data.

The yen has long been among the assets in greatest demand during disasters, when waves of overseas-held capital traditionally flee back to Japan, pushing the currency higher.  And for more than two decades, the trend has held. Since 1997, a 5% fall in the U.S. S&P500 index was accompanied 76% of the time by yen appreciation, according to a study by Nordea.  In mid-March, when the pandemic shock was at its height, that didn\\'t happen. U.S. equities tumbled 9% and 15% in successive weeks but the yen fell too. In subsequent selloffs, including this month\\'s 4% ( ) equity slump, the currency has barely budged. \"The correlation with stocks didn\\'t hold during the corona crisis, which is a game changer as to how everyone looks at the yen,\" Andreas Steno Larsen, chief global FX strategist at Nordea Markets, said.  The inverse 90-day yen-S&P500 correlation has since weakened to near decade-lows, he noted. (Graphic: Yen stock correlations - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdjownpo/yen%20stock%20correlations.JPG) Between Jan 20 and Sept 9, the yen firmed 2% against a basket of major currencies,   (NYSE: ) calculates - a stark contrast with its 27% surge during the July-March 2008-9 crisis.  Any lasting shift carries profound implications.  For Japan\\'s export-reliant economy, having frequently contended with sudden yen spikes, it is a positive. Investors though, face a hunt for other safe havens, should the yen lose that status. It\\'s a source of unease for investors such as Aaron Hurd, senior currency portfolio manager at State Street Global Markets, who uses the yen as a counterweight to risky assets in some investment models. While Hurd doesn\\'t believe the yen has shed its safe-haven role, he said its gains during recent risk-off episodes had been \"a bit disappointing\" and needed monitoring.

But it is also linked to a well established market trend - the carry trade, where low-yield currencies are borrowed and then sold for higher-yield assets overseas. That makes the yen prone to periodic spikes; when world markets go into reverse, so do carry trades, fuelling a mass rush back into the funding currency to limit losses. But yen-funded carry trades declined to around 8 trillion yen ($75.5 billion) in July, estimates Tohru Sasaki, JPMorgan (NYSE: )\\'s head of Japan market research, down from a steady 10 trillion yen or so in recent years and a 2007 peak around 23 trillion yen. What\\'s changed is that this year\\'s worldwide collapse in short-term rates has eliminated the yield discount the yen has held since 1995, when Japanese benchmark rates fell to 0.5%. Oliver Brennan, macro strategist at TS Lombard, noted Swiss and euro zone interest rates were below Japan\\'s, so \"if yen shorts from carry trades are going to be much smaller ...then the yen would no longer act as a risk-off currency.\"  While Japanese three-month money market rates  (Graphic: Borrowing costs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbjokovq/borrowing%20costs.JPG) EURO HAVEN?

But guessing the identity of the next haven currency is already \"the hottest topic in FX markets\", says Nordea\\'s Steno Larsen. The shifting FX dynamics may test the European Central Bank. With -0.5% interest rates, a balance of payments surplus, large capital markets and recent improvements in European cohesion, the euro might well be a candidate to replace the yen. One central bank official recalled the euro\\'s sudden spike to 14-month highs in March, driven possibly by carry traders who had used it for funding before turmoil erupted. \"It may be due to the fact that running up to the COVID-19 stress there had been some shifts in the preferred funding currency for carry trades and\\xa0the euro emerged as the currency you want to be short,\" he said.

Nagging doubts over whether Republican President Trump would agree to hand over the keys to the White House if he loses have grown in recent weeks. And during the first debate on Tuesday, Trump declined to commit to accepting the results, repeating his unfounded complaint that mail-in ballots would lead to election fraud. Trump repeatedly interrupted Democratic rival Joe Biden in the Cleveland debate, the first ahead of the Nov. 3 vote, as the rival candidates traded barbs over Trump\\'s taxes, the economy, the coronavirus pandemic and the integrity of the election. \"The debate drew further attention to the potential for a contested election,\" said Hani Redha, global multi-asset portfolio manager, at Pinebridge. \"It is likely market participants will continue to price in this issue, heightening volatility all the way to election day and its immediate aftermath.\"  U.S. stock futures  Options on the S&P 500 index show investors bracing for volatility in November and December -- likely because the use of mail-in ballots by voters concerned about the coronavirus could mean delays of weeks or even months in announcing the winner.  \"You can see the concern especially if you look at the shift in U.S. index futures pre-debate to post debate... certainly the concern was centred on the scope for post-election disputes,\" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at Raymond James. Trump declined last week to commit to a peaceful transfer of power if he loses, and said he expected the election battle to end up before the Supreme Court. \"Trump is very clearly laying the groundwork to dispute the election,\" said John Woolfitt, director of trading at Atlantic Capital Markets, a brokerage. \"Many Americans do not understand their own electoral process, it is not officially called on the night, it is usually unofficially called by the press and it requires the President (or challenger) to concede.\" BIDEN AHEAD Meanwhile, election betting odds on Betfair Exchange, the operator of the world\\'s largest online betting bourse, showed Biden\\'s probability of winning at 60%, up from 56% before the debate. Trump has a 40% probability of victory. Biden, 77, has held a consistent lead over Trump, 74, in opinion polls, although surveys in the battleground states that will decide the election show a closer contest. More than a million Americans are already casting early ballots and time is running out to change minds or influence the small sliver of undecided voters. The first of three scheduled debates came at a fraught moment on Wall Street. The S&P 500 ( ) tumbled around 10% from record highs this month before paring some of those losses as investors fretted about the coronavirus impact and election uncertainty. Some investors view Biden as more likely to raise taxes, and see a second term for Trump, who favors tax cuts and deregulation, as better for the stock market. However, a Trump win could spell more tensions between Washington and Beijing.  Before the 2016 election, investors widely predicted that a Trump victory would hurt stocks due to his unpredictability and trade war threats against China and Mexico. However, the S&P 500 surged 5% in the month following his unexpected election win. \"The markets almost always think they favor a Republican but did just fine under Clinton and Obama. There is comfort in that hindsight perspective regardless of what happens,\" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The buck is up nearly 2% in September as of Tuesday against a basket of currencies, on track for its best monthly gain in 14 months and outpacing the performance of many other traditional destinations for nervous investors in what has been a turbulent period for stocks. Gold  Several catalysts are stoking the dollar\\'s rebound, which has put the greenback at its highest level since late July. The U.S. currency\\'s 8% decline from its highs in March has left it looking comparatively cheaper than assets like gold, which stood at all-time highs last month. The yen\\'s haven status, meanwhile, may have suffered in the wake of a pandemic-era collapse in global rates. \"The dollar\\'s resurgence has ... to do with the response of the capital markets to the global wave of de-risking,\" said Thanos Bardas, managing director and co-head of global investment-grade fixed income at Neuberger Berman.  At the same time, many of the factors that made the dollar less attractive in recent months appear to be dissipating. COVID-19 cases are accelerating in Europe, threatening expectations of growth that boosted the euro, while worries over a hard Brexit have weighed on the British pound.  Additionally, speculation over the possibilities of negative interest rates in the UK and Australia have dimmed the allure of those currencies to some investors, although such a move seems far off. In the United States, uncertainty stemming from the Nov. 3 presidential election and the shrinking likelihood of lawmakers agreeing on a fiscal stimulus package this year have fueled haven demand. Bardas said Neuberger added to bets that the dollar will rise against the euro, a currency he believes is overvalued after a 10% run since March.  Chester Ntonifor, foreign exchange strategist at BCA Research, said spikes in equity market volatility have tended to boost the U.S. currency, as does turbulence in foreign exchange markets after long periods of placid trading. Broader currency market volatility, as measured by   (DE: )  The   has risen by an average of roughly 2% in the two most recent upsurges of volatility. Others see the rally as a chance to take profit on the dollar or place bets against the currency, believing it will resume weakening once markets grow calmer.  \"I have been a dollar bull. But I am using this opportunity to sell dollars when everybody is buying,\" said Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management, who is selling dollars to buy yen. The dollar\\'s rally received a tailwind from a \"nasty short squeeze,\" as investors betting on a weaker U.S. currency were forced to unwind their bets in recent weeks, said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of currency strategy and portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management.  The possibility of further positioning unwinds remains - net bets on a weaker dollar in futures markets stood at $33.6 billion in the latest week, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed, near a nine-year high. But Upadhyaya has added to his fund\\'s anti-dollar bets by buying the euro and Czech koruna.  \"This is a healthy correction that is needed to ensure that a further depreciation in the dollar has legs,\" he said.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had \"productive\" conversations on Wednesday and now agree on more parts of what a stimulus package should contain, even though they still remain some $600 billion apart on the overall size of the measures, according to various reports. Stock futures had earlier trimmed their premarket gains after data showing that   fell by 2.7% in August, following the end of enhanced unemployment benefits in July. While   still grew, it did so at a reduced rate of 1.0%. Those numbers were published at the same time as data showing that   continue to run at abormally high levels - 837,000 more people filing claims last week. The number of continuing claims, by contrast, fell by nearly 1 million, more sharply than expected.\\xa0 The decline in claims was \"welcome, but not definitive\", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.\\xa0 \"With total initial claims, regular plus (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance), at almost 1.5 million per week, the labor market clearly is still in turmoil.\" Elsewhere, the Institute of Supply Management\\'s manufacturing survey showed activity cooled a little in September, although the pace of labor-shedding by the sector slowed.
